If you went into certain cities in Europe in the 16, 17, 1800s, the nicest
building would be the bank. If you walk into my building and you give me
your money, the likelihood that I will return your money to you upon your request
is high. That's a probabilistic world. What I'm talking about is a deterministic world. Mathematically
guaranteed relationships, mathematically guaranteed transactions, mathematically guaranteed ownership. Really, if I could get everything mathematically
guaranteed, I would. would. Is there one thing that would not make sense to be
deterministic over probabilistic. probabilistic. Sergey Nazaro, the co-founder of Chainlink,

from. from. A lot of the people that I know that are successful, they have
been in the state of poverty. The phrase necessities, the mother of invention. So, I've
always liked that phrase. What's one of the absolute hardest problems that every network founder
faces. faces. It's getting a first killer use case. That's the hardest thing for Chain
Link. That was DeFi. And then that gave us the

traction, the legitimacy to build all the other use cases. Can you explain decentralized finance
to a 13-year-old. When you have a relationship with the bank, they control your money
and whether or not you can have it. When you have something called decentralized finance,
you control your money. money. Some people believe you're a Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto. I think
it's because I was really early in this industry. I think that isn't even a
single person. I think it's a group of people. You're not Satoshi. Are you a
genius. So how can crypto networks become a public good

if Ethereum has Vitaliki, Solana has Anatoli, Polka Dot has Gavin, and Chain Link has

like overwhelmed by the amount of stuff going on, but uh it's it's good. It's
like a good it's a good type of uh overwhelmed. overwhelmed. It's a good poem
to have, I guess. So, yes, that's how I think

about it. Yeah. But I'm just I'm just like my brain's just catching up. Where
am I right now from like all the stuff even the stuff that happened when
I was coming over here. here. What's that stuff. What's the biggest thing that occupies
your mind right now. It's actually how to get all the uh Tradfi people onto
chains and onto Chain Link. Link. That's that's kind of where everything's going because that's
where all the money is. That's that's what's what's going to drive our industry because
our our industry is driven by net new capital and

there's another you know 3 4 trillion in retail capital but if you look at
the penetration of crypto into the retail world in developed economies and emerging markets depending
on the country it's already relatively high so I don't think that the retail community
is going to take crypto past 10 trillion but when you look at trfine capital
markets uh That's hundreds of trillions. And where you want to be in this industry
is you want to be at the place where the net new capital is coming
in through. M M M that's kind of always the

thing that however people feel about it is the thing that drives the industry or
where it goes. How contradicting is this with the the the original crypto ethos that
brought you into the space more than 10 years ago. So the original ethos that
brought me into the space actually is why I went to a bunch of Bitcoin
meetups and I met a bunch of people that are libertarian and I kind of
knew what libertarianism was. This was about like 2010 11 something like that but I
didn't really meet a lot of people that were into

that that were libertarian themselves. And so I started talking to them and I I
kind of understood that this was very aligned with my views. And so I kind
of became more and more libertarian and and agreed with them. But the thing with
with being libertarian is is maybe a little bit confused sometimes with people doing what
they want to do versus what you want them to do. So people think libertarian
approach to a libertarian approach to society and to life and and to and to
how you know things should work is is about being

anti-establishment. anti-establishment. It's actually about choice. Right. So, if somebody wants to put 100% of
their wealth in Bitcoin, that's a completely reasonable that's a choice. That's that's the thing.
And if they want to have private key control over that, uh, that's a choice
they should have. And if they want to take that Bitcoin and quote unquote ape
into some lending market and, you know, repackage that and get a bunch of memecoin
yield on top of it and like, you know, do 50 other things that has
risk, but that's their choice. And and so that's what

in my opinion our industry does is it provides all of these choices for how
to control value, for how to have relationships between entities, between peers in ways that
didn't exist before. And what the capital markets and the trady world uh provide is
just a new dimension of choice. But that dimension of choice, interestingly enough has so
much capital behind it uh that I think our industry is going to end up
embracing it. And and really the choice that most people in our industry make is
I want Bitcoin to become more valuable, right. So that's

kind of really their fundamental choice. And that's why, you know, Black Rockck before it
it starts pumping liquidity into the Bitcoin market is not a good thing. You know,
we're all very everyone's really anti- Black Rockck in the industry like a couple of
years ago and then a month after they understand that Black Rockck and Larry Frink
are the thing that's going to help them float the Bitcoin price to to new
levels. levels. They're very positive. You know, it's like the best thing ever is is
Larry Frink and Black Rockck and and so that that

signals that, you know, the choice that was really made was that they want the
value of Bitcoin to go higher. So that's also a reasonable choice. you know, that's
their choice. That's kind of their position on the thing. Um, the people that want
cryptocurrencies and blockchains to kind of remove the need for institutions completely, there's actually very
few people that even understand what that means. Mhm. And most of them didn't even
understand what that means. If you ask them, hey, look, you know, Bitcoin could go
to a million bucks with the help of institutions. Or

we could get rid of all the institutions, but Bitcoin is at 10,000 bucks. Which
would you which would you prefer. My guess is that 90% plus are going to
go, you know, I'll take the Bitcoin at a million bucks and I'll figure out
the institution thing soon after. I'll just let's just do that next right after that
one. So, and and that's also their choice. they can have that choice. The the
the problem is not that there are institutions. The the problem is that there is
some kind of level of control that eliminates the ability

for people to have, you know, reasonable economic and personal choices. That's the thing that
that I think makes sense and actually that's what blockchains do even for the trfy
world because in the trady world people don't always understand all the nuances there but
there is a limitation of choice there as well. It's like how do I know
things about my counterparty the person you know the the entity that I'm dealing with.
How do I know it's solvent. How do I know that it will fulfill its
obligations. like in the 2008 derivatives uh related crisis where

a lot of the derivatives weren't settled and paid out. That's, you know, a serious
problem. If if we can put a bunch of information on chain and I can
provide you with the choice to know everything that you could ever want to know
about your counterparty and therefore manage your risk better, then great. I you know, the
system has given you that better choice. I think that's really what what this will
do. It'll just give a whole bunch of people a bunch of new choices, a
different level of control. It's not necessary to eliminate, you

know, entire categories of how the world works unless that part of the world is
is is controlling things in a way that eliminates people's choice. And you you have
that in some really like authoritarian parts of the world. And that's where I think
crypto will have a very very very uh freeing kind of effect. But in the
vast majority of the developed world, it'll just create more choice among a large amount
of choices already. If that if that adds up for you. Dear When Shift Happens
family, the following message is probably the single most important

thing you should take away from today's podcast. If you're serious about your crypto investing
journey, please take some time to learn how to self-custody your assets to make sure
that nobody can take your coins away ever. If you don't learn how to be
your own bank, it is very likely that one day you will lose all your
hard-earned crypto. The safest way to hold your crypto is in a cold storage that
we also call hardware wallet. Hardware wallets are not complicated and they give you peace
of mind. I personally use a hardware wallet called Treasure.

It is open source, very easy to use, and the first hardware wallet created ever.
As we have to say in crypto, not your keys, not your coin. You can
order your Treasure Wallet with a 10% discount by following the link in the description
down below and by using the promo code WSH10. And now back to the episode.
If you have to explain what it is you do and why you do it
to someone who's never heard of the words sovereignty, blockchain, web 3, Bitcoin before, what
would you say. So I would say we connect many

valuable systems to make transactions work well and and and in line with what we
just said kind of provide people new choices about how they can manage their money
interact with each other online uh prove things about the real world to each other
uh instead of relying on the news uh that's what I would say like it
doesn't our system actually it it powers a lot of smart contracts and uh and
uh tokens because those systems rely heavily on the guarantees of a system like ours
proving things to them. But realistically, our system, the chain

link network and its standards can prove and connect all kinds of systems. So for
example, the chain link network can prove whether a number of weather events happened and
it can prove whether that happened to a smart contract or it can prove it
to a server. But what that's doing is that's providing certain secure connectivity and proof
and it's basically enabling a transaction. Uh if you think about the world in like
a transactional model, most of people's daily interactions are some form of transaction basically. Uh
you know transaction of you know my information in return

for your information that's like a conversation right I you learn something from me I
learned something from you. uh transaction in the sense of you know we have some
work relationship I'm giving you labor you're giving me capital so I think it's like
a reimagining of how transactions work is what our is what our system does and
uh it does that on the basis of uh mathematical guarantees. So the the big
difference between the way our system does things and the and the traditional world does
it is that you get mathematically guaranteed results rather than

uh people guaranteed results. And that's the very big difference. And that mathematically guaranteed result
is actually useful uh on on a chain, but I think it's also very useful
outside of a chain. It's it's a guarantee, right. It's it's a guarantee that we
verified something in a way that it's not going to be manipulated. Similarly to how
when a blockchain verifies a transaction in a block, it's guaranteeing you that that transaction
is going to get in and work. So, so that's what I know you asked
me not to say. I'm past the answer to the

thing now. Um, so the the blockchains, they verify blocks of transactions. Our system verifies
all the stuff outside of a blockchain. And so when you combine those two things,
you get these next generation smart contracts like DeFi, which chain link chain link powers
the the vast majority of uh the smart contracts in DeFi. You get decentralized smart
contract based crop insurance. You get get get derivatives. You get a whole bunch of
great stuff that wasn't going to work that way before. Like before the way it
would have worked is a person could decide what they

want to do and and you don't have much um much say. What's the problem
with that. What what what do you tell your friend who lives in New York
and uses either the banking like the the normal banking system or uses this kind
of like nail banks to just you know Venmo cash app to just send money
around or I use a transfer wise right wise to send money abroad. It's pretty
cheap. It's super fast. I'm happy with that. Well, first of all, I tell almost
everybody as little as I can. That's that's one thing

just to answer your question like a weird way. But if I compare the system
to transfer wise or if I compare uh blockchains as a settlement layer, I think
the difference is is you have a better middleman in these um crossborder transfer apps
relative to the correspondent banking system. So the correspondent banking system takes a lot of
fees, takes a lot of time. That's, you know, what people usually compare it to,
but at the end of the day, you still have um a company that could
misbehave. One one good example that that you might be

familiar with is a company called Wirecard. So Wirecard was this very exciting actually exactly
what you said, payments, fintech. I think it was the leading payments company in Germany
and it ended up um manipulating its auditors for for for an extended period of
time and and that manipulation of their auditors basically made it so that even though
you you had money in the system, you you woke up one day and that
money wasn't there anymore because it got stolen by wild card basically and they and
and they were able to game the auditors. So, how

would that look in in a mathematically guaranteed system. Well, in a mathematically guaranteed guaranteed
system, you wouldn't have auditors going and having conversations about what do you have, what
what don't you have. You'd have something like proof of reserves, right. So, you'd have
a system that verifies in a near realtime basis what is the what is the
capital inside of this uh thing, whether it's for a stable coin or a payments
network. Uh that's what what I'm talking about, right. So in that world, you wouldn't
have had Birdie Manov. You wouldn't have had the Lehman

bankruptcy and the inability to settle all those derivatives. derivatives. You wouldn't have had um
FTX like if FTX had proof of reserves. You wouldn't have had that that issue
because it would have proven what what's there. You wouldn't have had proof you wouldn't
have had Silicon Valley Bank. if you had something called proof of composition. So proof
of reserves shows you that something is there. Proof of composition shows you what's there.
So the problem with Silicon Valley Bank for example was that you didn't you knew
they had treasuries but you didn't know the vintage or

the yield of the treasury relative to their other obligations. So all of these things
do a really good job at creating a brand and that's that's that's like a
very long time thing. If you went into gold mining towns or if you went
into certain cities in Europe in the 16 17 1800s the nicest building would be
the bank. It would be the the the building with like the biggest arches and
the biggest columns. It would be and and the reason for that it's a brand,
right. It's like I'm very secure. I can afford huge

columns. If you walk into into my building and you give me your money, the
likelihood that I will return your money to you upon your request is high, right.
But but you know, then there were a bunch of bank runs and and bankruptcies
also through, you know, throughout time. Then you had the FDIC emerge and regulators and
all this random stuff, but it still happens. See, that's uh that's a probabilistic world.
So there's a probability there. deterministic world. So what I'm talking about is a world
that's guaranteed to mathematically operate in a certain way. And

that mean that good example is your uh Bitcoin private key. So your Bitcoin private
key will according to the laws of mathematics and cryptography and and those mathematically guaranteed
rules, it will always execute a transaction for you under those rules. There could be
a million people who don't want that transaction to go through is going to go
through through through as long as you have the private key and you and you
enter the transaction and and and you put it on the chain, right. So there's
there there's no person making decisions there. That's mathematically guaranteed.

mathematically guaranteed. And I personally think that mathematically guaranteed relationships, mathematically guaranteed transactions, mathematically guaranteed
ownership, mathematically guaranteed insurance, mathematically guaranteed really if I could get everything mathematically guaranteed, I
would. So I Yeah. What's What's an example of something that you think I mean,
you just said if I could get everything mathematically guaranteed, I would. That's a good
question. I've never gotten that question. Is there something that I wouldn't want to be
mathematically guaranteed. Nope. In in all my agreements, I want the agreements to be fulfilled.
So if if I could get every every agreement that

I ever make with anybody to be mathematically guaranteed, mathematically guaranteed, mathematically guaranteed, I think
that's always kind of superior. That's always a superior state to be in is to
have a mathematically guaranteed agreement. Uh for example, I was a few minutes late for
us to meet up right now. You know, imagine if that wasn't possible. If people
could never be late because it was, you know, somehow was mathematically guaranteed they'd be
on time. if you had that choice, you know, would you would you rather they
always be I would I would choose always on time,

you know. So, I would do I would do that that I mean that's actually
one of the reasons I really believe in this stuff. I I think people have
been existing in a a probabilistic world so long they don't understand that there's this
alternative. Most people still don't understand. Like if you ask them what's the difference between
a Bitcoin and a bank account, they'll say something about digital gold and something about
deflationary token schedule, something but but they won't mention mention mention private keys and direct
control, right. Which which is I I would say one

of the if I would say it's maybe the main innovation is that you you
can have direct control over something. There's a system of transaction operating over there and
you have direct control. A bank account in your pocket. I mean it's not exact.
It's not it's it's a Bitcoin account. It's a Bitcoin account in your pocket. Uh
I I don't know. I mean if it's 100 if 100% of everything you have
is in Bitcoin then then then it becomes a bank account. account. I don't know
exactly who's doing that but you know they're right so

far. So maybe maybe that's what everyone should do. I don't Who are you. Where
am I. I'm Sergey. from Chainlink at least for the last approximately eight years. Sergey
from chain link. Chain link all day long. All day and all night. Yep. Basically
wake up thinking about chain link. Go to sleep thinking about chain link. chain link.
How much how much do you sleep. Not enough. Less and less now with everything
going on. Some people actually can run on very low sleep. So little sleep. I
mean, I can't definitely, but definitely, but definitely, but me

either. So, I gota I got to work on that for sure. There's a common
pattern across most of the very successful people I interview on this podcast. They have
something that happened in their life that gave them a chip on the shoulder and
made them really hungry. [Music] I mean, I think there there's a lot of truth
in the in the phrase necessity is the mother of invention. So, I've always I've
always liked uh like that phrase. And really, generally speaking, a lot of the people
that I know that are successful, successful, successful, they have

been in like a state of poverty at some point in their lives. And so
that's kind of the the experience that I had because my family immigrated to the
US from Russia in the 90s with uh let's say not a lot and so
everybody was working a lot. Uh I started working pretty early in my life and
uh that type of thing of thing of thing gives you an appreciation let's say
for opportunity. So there are people who don't have to work and there are people
who are fine just continuing down a certain path. And

And And when I when I kind of really unders understood it a little bit
actually was when I started reading more and more philosophy philosophy philosophy uh specifically like
uh Markx and uh and some of these economic writers that they explained how capitalism
works and so the opportunity in capitalism is to make something. So historically in the
past throughout history you wouldn't really have much opportunity to make things. You have to
work for someone who owned the means of production. So they own own the means
to produce the the the farmed food or you know

the textile mill or or something. And so the ability to create a means of
production, the ability to create the thing that creates value was actually a very limited
uh opportunity to you know very limited group of people. You you you couldn't do
what people can do in the US and a few other countries where you can
create something valuable something valuable something valuable like you couldn't sit down as a as
an individual engineer and code. And now as an individual engineer you you don't even
need to code. you just you talk to the AI

and you do some weird vibe coding stuff, right. So, the the ability to create
things is uh is the type of opportunity that is kind of like I think
still shockingly overlooked by many people. But basically, if you're if you're if you're pretty
poor and you understand how capitalism works, I think you pretty quickly arrive to the
idea, hey, you know, I better create something valuable and make sure that it and
it continues to provide a lot of value. value. Uh and that's kind that's kind
of a unique opportunity. unique opportunity. So I think that's

kind that's that's kind of the the set of logical basic thoughts that uh that
I thought through and then when you when you actually start creating things I think
what happens is you start weighing the benefit of that thing both from like a
commercial point of view and from a societal point of view at least some people
weigh the societal thing and the societal thing is is a very kind of purpose
generating thing actually. thing actually. So that that kind of comes a little bit later.
Initially I think what you're doing is you're thinking you

know how do I how do I get somewhere and so when I got into
this industry I was initially a Bitcoin miner. Bitcoin miner. Uh this was like 2010
11 the these years when the difficulty was much lower and and when there weren't
any other coins so all you could do is be a bitcoin miner and I
didn't even really understand bitcoin I was just mining it and kind of looking into
it and trying to understand and I I thought that bitcoin was it but then
there were other chains chains chains and so I kind

of started to understand that this thing could create these mathematical relationships because when I
got into the industry The only mathematically guaranteed relationship that you could have was Bitcoin.
Like I have a Bitcoin, I can send you a Bitcoin. You have a Bitcoin,
you can send me a Bitcoin. That's it. That that was the whole scope of
what all of this could do. But when I realized that you could expand that
to other things, other things, other things, I actually really liked the version of the
world that that could create. And and that's where where

I think a lot of people that work on things, they talk about something that
you're interested or passionate about being a valuable force in in your life and in
your thinking. thinking. And I never really understood that. But then but but but then
when I when I realized this, that's the first time I understood it, right. Because
I I was looking at something and I was like, well, if this thing can
can do all this stuff, stuff, stuff, then society or or the world can work
this way. this way. And that that when when you

when you see that for the first time and you look around and you're like,
well, who's doing this. doing this. If that's possible, then who's doing it. And you
see nobody. You're like, you're telling me nobody's doing this. You're you're telling me nobody's
like making DeFi happen. you're telling like from an Oracle point of view or like
an infra point of view, you're telling me nobody's going to enable the next generation
of of these smart contracts. At that point, you go like, "Wow, well, I I
better I better really do that because it's it's a

exciting thing. " exciting thing. " So, it's uh yeah, it's it kind of comes
to that, I think, later on. That's now the main thing actually for me is
is uh kind of I view it as my my one opportunity in my life
I think to to make a big dent on how the world works. Like I
don't I don't know if I'm going to get another chance in my life to
to have an impact on something that'll actually change how things work. And we've already
done that with chain link like powering the majority of

DeFi. Defi was like 10 15 teams when we started at sub 100 million as
a industry. Then it grew to thousands of teams with over 200 billion and us
continually powering the majority vast majority of that. So that was actually pretty exciting too,
right. to to to see your system that that you helped build with others power
this kind of cool revolutionary thing. Frankly, once once you go through that, once you
experience something like that, you're kind of hooked on that. And and so what what
I'm trying to do and what a lot of people

in in the team and and in the community, I think, are trying to do
is they're just trying to do that again and again and again. and and be
part of making something that accelerates another big boom like that. And it's a great
model because if if you can if you can accelerate a thing like the DeFi
summer, the DeFi boom or you can accelerate the cap markets in our industry or
you can accelerate blockchain gaming as as an infrastructure. infrastructure. Then you you do something
really valuable. You help people build cool things that you

know make the world better. better. and you you have fun doing it because it's
it's pretty exciting to do that. Uh there are these periods in between where you
have to work a lot and people don't don't really understand always what you're doing.
you're doing. But in my opinion, I I found that if people don't understand what
you're doing, it it usually means it's it can be a it can be a
valuable thing. Probably actually true. You mentioned the philosophy that actually helped you a lot.
You studied philosophy at NYU. And you have a small

slightly hidden section in your LinkedIn bio called my p my perspective on daily life
is based on a few philosophical quotes I want to dig into. We must stand
upright ourselves not be set up. set up. So that's where Marcus Aurelius is. So
that's a a kind of quote about doing things uh yourself. Uh, I think there's
another another well, no, there's not another part of that quote. There's quotes around that
stuff where it's like you you need to solve your own problems type of thing.
And there's other other not parts of that quote, but

other parts in that section are somewhere around there where it's like you're going to
wake up today and you're going to be met with ingratitude. You're going to be
met with all kinds of bad things. And and so basically for me, what that
quote means is that no one's coming to help you. So a lot a lot
of people I think they go through they go through life they think someone's coming
to help them. Someone's coming like some personal relationship or some romantic relationship or some
business relationship. Someone's coming to help. Someone's coming to make

it work for you and that's not going to happen. happen. What's the moment that
you realize that no one is coming to save or help. What's the moment I
realized no one's coming to save or help. Okay, let me think back. the moment
um the moment maybe possibly was when I was 5 years old and my bike
got stolen by a guy I let ride it and I really like that bike.
I'm still looking for him by the way. But um basically that I think that
that and a collection of similar moments in in that

in that four or five year old timeline was uh was probably the point at
which I realized that no one's uh no one's really going to be helping me
out. So either you help yourself out or you're going to have a hard life.
And a lot of people have a hard life because they trust the government take
care of them of their retirement of their health. They trust the systems which is
why we're here today actually because we trust the systems less. Wow. We're we're here.
We're here today because Bitcoin went to uh $2,000 because

a bunch of money in Asia wanted to get out and buy Bitcoin. That's why
I think we're here. That's that's why our that's what our industry is built on.
It's built on money and capital flows. There's an ideological component to our industry that's
very real. real. And I think that's going to that's going to end up happening.
But I I don't think that ideological component on its own gets our industry very
far. I think the value, the technical value that our industry provides, like when when
the Bitcoin price went to 30 bucks and when it

went to 2,000 bucks, it was because there's a a group of people that looked
at it and saw that it was a payment method and a value transfer method
that was unique and different. And those people, the vast majority of them had no
idea about any of these ideological things. And personally, I think the the vast majority
of people that use blockchain technology even today, like you you have this whole thing
in in our industry where it's like there's all these people seeking to make money
in some chain somewhere. I'm like, yeah, that's what financial

technology does. Financial technology enables people to make money um in in in certain ways.
So I think institutions and them getting replaced in my experience with institutions, institutions, institutions,
people's conspiracy theories about institutions institutions institutions assume a level of competence that simply does
not exist. Like I I have dealt with many institutions. institutions. Makes sense. And I've
I've I've seen some theories about those institutions and then I go to the institutions
and I deal with the people in the institutions and I meet all the senior
sometimes very senior people in institutions and unless unless these

people like have split personality disorder and when they go to sleep another guy wakes
up and like does a whole bunch of stuff at night and then goes to
sleep and wake and they wake up and they unless there's two two different like
like like psychosis things going on in their Um Um Um I mean most institutions
frankly just want to exist so the people that work there can have a 9
toive job. Many of them are really not not planning things. The the people the
people that make the institutions problematic are actually the ones

that find inefficiencies from the existence of the institutions and then they exploit them. So
they they find a way where the institution says it's doing its job but they
can't actually do their job and then they find a way to exploit that. That's
like fraud. So so like the the the people that actually that actually that actually
make institutions not work really are the people who who find a loophole to exploit
them. exploit them. That's a good example is like uh you know Bernie Maidoffs a
good example right so there's like an institutional system that

that gives people certain assumptions about you know the solveny of his thing and he
exploits holes in that model and that and he he's able he's able to to
steal that money because he's he's able to convince people that the institution or or
the institution convinces people that like the auditor or the regulator or whoever convinces people
that it works. That that's actually usually where I see the problems happen for people
from institutions. Um is is that someone has exploited them for for for the purposes
of of taking other people's money and then the institution

gets really angry and like wakes up for 10 minutes and all all the people
in institution go like, "Holy we like this is really painful. People are really upset.
We got to pass new laws. " Mhm. And then they pass new laws and
the new laws layer on the old laws and and and that results in this
kind of um regulatory slowdown regulatory slowdown regulatory slowdown which you know was was going
to happen to our industry before the new administration in the US but now I
I don't think it's going to happen as much. So

the real the real downside of institutions for me is that they actually overprotect people.
they overly make regulations make regulations make regulations because like you had one or two
failures. A good example for the crypto industry that people can relate to is like
FTX, right. So FTX happens or Terra happens happens happens and the institutional world massively
overindexes on that and everything slows down massively, right. where what you actually want you
want the institutional world to say to legitimize us. legitimize us. You what what what
we all want really if if we want you know

Bitcoin to do well and if we want our industry to do well is we
want institutions like Black Rockck like others of that size to legitimize our industry. That's
what we really want. M we we want to we want to get into a
productive collaborative relationship with institutions with institutions with institutions because actually that's the path to
mainstream adoption because then the institutions are not just supporting the um uh alternative to
crypto and blockchains which are the you know the banks and and the existing thing.
They're actually putting our industry on a level playing field.

And if we get on a level playing field with, you know, the traditional world,
then we'll absolutely win. absolutely win. In my opinion, we'll and and and people don't
also realize what winning looks like. What winning looks like is what happened with the
internet. So what winning looks like is that the um the banks and the asset
managers become part of our industry. It's not it's not that our industry destroys them.
like it in some of them who who don't get on board. They might not
do well. Like there there are plenty of companies that

when the internet came around, they didn't get on board. Many of them don't exist
anymore. They got replaced. got replaced. Uh but there are companies that got on board
with the internet and they're doing even better because of it. So that's that's what
we want in my opinion. opinion. If one does not know to what port one
is sailing, no wind is favorable. Yeah, that that one's about priorities. So the the
I I feel like I'm I'm giving a lot of unsolicited advice. Okay, kind of
solicited, I guess. I don't know. Um yeah, so goals

goals are important. Priorities are important. If if you if you don't have goals and
priorities, someone else is going to give you goals and priorities. And the the the
the other part of that quote is that let's say you get really lucky. Let's
say there's this awesome opportunity in front of you, but you're not you haven't prioritized
doing that. And so it can come and go because even if it gets right
in front of you, you're not going to grab it. you're going to let it
go. You're going to go it's going to go right

by because you're not thinking about it. It's also about how the mind works. If
if you start thinking about something, if you start thinking about blue Toyotaas, you just
say blue Toyota to yourself like 20 times, you'll notice a bunch more Toyotas. And
if you see a blue Toyota, you're going to remember it. Like it's just like
what what you're thinking about. So what what happens with people that set goals is
that they look for the opportunities. So the their mind kind of gets turned on.
And so when the wind is blowing in the right

direction and you know where you're sailing in that quote Mhm. you it just it
just it just happens kind of naturally. But if if you if you if you're
not looking for the opportunity, it could literally just be standing in front of you
and it doesn't matter because you're not looking for it because you haven't decided what's
important. So that's important. That's that's a really good one. one. Last one. Every new
beginning comes from some other beginnings end. I don't remember that. Is that Emerson or
who is that. Sena. That's Senica. Okay. the same as

the previous one actually. So the every new beginning I mean that's just kind of
a hopeful hopeful thing, right. Like one door closes, another door opens. Uh since that's
since that's from Senica, the the Stoics are very good at helping you deal with
hardship. So that's a really good one if there's hardship. So let's say something didn't
work out. work out. Well, you know, the bright side is you don't got to
spend your time on that anymore. anymore. You can spend your time on something else.
else. Maybe that thing's going to end up better. And

personally, I've actually found that sometimes sometimes, not always, to be true. There were things
I was working on, total waste of time. Like earlier earlier in my life, and
they didn't work out. And the important thing with that with that is to just
make sure they don't work out sooner. How do you do that. I I don't
know. I mean, I I think you just have a certain standard for deciding if
something's working out. And And that standard, by the way, that standard doesn't mean quitting
on doing things. Sometimes people get confused about that. They

get confused by like, I'm not going to do startups because a startup didn't work
out. That's not the same thing. is like this thing, this product or this idea
or this direction didn't work out, but that doesn't mean that there aren't 50 other
directions where you shouldn't be building something new and exciting and useful. Does that make
sense. So that's what I would what I would say which is hard to do
because there is this kind of s cost, right. That you do all this investment
in time. I mean it it depends if you're starting

completely again or if you're basically pivoting or changing the direction of the thing. But
I think what prevents most of the people to probably make the tougher decision on
a job, a startup, a relationship is that this guy. He's good. This guy is
good. He's going to survive this guy. This guy's survivor. I can tell. I can
tell already. He went through a bunch of hardship and he was like, this is
this one is a survivor. Sergey is not going to stop me from around. around.
He's not afraid of me at all. Um he's like,

I seen a million of you guys. You're not even that good at this. I'm
not particularly afraid of you. Um yeah. So I I think the thing with with
with that is you have to choose a general direction. So, I've seen people switch
directions between industries. Like they make a iPhone app and then they make a, you
know, flower delivery company and then they make a dry clean. This isn't a real
example, but like it's just very different. different. So, I think it's important to choose
a direction and then do things in that direction. direction.

So, I chose the direction of these cryptographically guaranteed things and built a lot of
different stuff. We built cryptomail which was the the the first blockchain email service. We
built secure asset exchange. We built smartcontract. com. smartcontract. We built uh you know then
chain link and but it was all always in this kind of direction of cryptographically
guaranteed messages or cryptographically guaranteed exchange or cryptographically guaranteed transactions or now cryptographically guaranteed cryptographically
guaranteed cryptographically guaranteed verifications via oracles. So Mhm. So that is an example of a
direction and the the direction is really kind of uh

I would say an industry choice. So it's I want to work in the car
industry or I want to work in the AI industry or I want to you
know I want to be part of this industry. I want to be part of
this. That is that is an example of a more permanent choice in my or
or or a choice that you should you should do over two to five years.
Unless you figure out that that whole industry is not good. But once you choose
a direction in an industry, then in my opinion, you

should you should try to find something in there. If that's exciting to you, one
of the worst things to do in my opinion is to choose an industry that
you don't like with like people you don't like or problems you don't like or
a market you you know the the market dynamics are not are not something you
want to be involved in. I remember going to all these Bitcoin meetups early on
and then meetups for other coins and tokens and uh you know before they were
called appcoins appcoins appcoins and I like the people there.

I like the people. I like the problems they were talking about. I like the
things they were trying to solve for. And uh I mean I could see that
this thing had a lot of value and it was going to make a lot
of sense from like an economic and a and a product value point of view,
but I also just liked the ethos of the people people people and I I
just like the industry. That makes a lot easier. the Yeah, that makes it that
makes it a lot easier when when when you believe

in the the direction. I think Naval Rabon says something like the most important thing
is not who you work with, but what you work with, what you work on.
Obviously, who you work with is very important, but you could be I mean, again,
like the industry, you could do something that's not necessarily that great. If the industry
is doing well, you're much more likely to be successful, at least in the short
term, right. and to be motivated and maybe to find your way into something that
works better afterwards. Yeah, there there's a good post um

from from Mark Andre I think that I always liked when I was younger. It's
called the only thing that matters. I think that's the name of the post and
it it compares the the importance of market versus product versus team and it says
that market is actually the most important factor because a growing market will define what
a good product is and it will pull it out of the team. So if
the team is if the team is moderately competent moderately competent moderately competent and and
they and they've stumbled into a market where they can

provide value then the market will essentially pull the product out of the team. And
what they have to do is they have to be receptive to making sure that
that happens which I found to be true. There's a lot of teams that are
in really markets with relatively well-built products. They just won't go anywhere. anywhere. this industry.
Fantastic market. Fantastic. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, absolutely. absolutely. And it sounds for example when you
are in this industry, it sounds so logical, right. But I mean I built a
data analytics company before but it was on the consulting

side and now I realize the difference. like the blockchain is I mean the blockchain
crypto is like this kind of endlessly forgiving industry where as as long as it
keeps growing that that's that's the nuance that some people that have been around here
so long might not I think many of them understand understand understand but this industry
is a great industry as long as it keeps growing that's this this thing has
to keep growing that's why we need traditional finance well that's that's where why you
need liquidity liquidity liquidity and capital from wherever you can

get it Mhm. And so my basic question is where's that coming from guys. Like
and and then every some people might tell me, hey, it's coming from the retail
user. And I'm like, yeah, yeah, you're right. Like maybe the more the industry can
double from that. I can see that. Maybe even triple from that. that. But but
then I look at the penetration rates of like people like if we go outside
right now we talk to 10 people think seven out of the 10 people will
know what Bitcoin is if not more that's not the

same situation five years ago 10 years ago right so and and and and then
they're like well there's a lot of other markets there's a lot of other ones
okay there's a lot of other ones we go talk to 10 people three you'll
know five will know how many will know so it has to come from somewhere.
from somewhere. And so this is where I think this this Black Rockck effect is
just going to happen in mass for the Tradfi community. And I I think people
are now starting to slowly understand that like the ability

to deal with tradi, the ability to get the biggest banks, the biggest asset managers
to pump their their clients money and their clients liquidity into digital assets into tokenized
funds into, you know, whatever onchain thing the client wants is uh is is the
next frontier of this growth. And everyone in our industry gets behind growth. They they
get that's what everyone gets behind. The ideological thing I'm behind that and our community
is behind that. That's a great thing and that's something that's like going to happen
as a result of that growth. That growth doesn't happen.

Then this thing wasn't true. Like this thing didn't work out. But it's actually the
growth that'll that'll solidify all of these ways of doing things into the real world.
Absolutely. Very practical. Very practical take. Can you explain decentralized finance to a 13year-old. Um
I could go younger or older. I'm not sure I could do teen. I'm not
teenagers these you know they to a child to a child. Good. Okay fine. child.
I don't know that by by the time you're teenagers, the attention span seems very
low now. Like even even lower only teenagers. Yeah, I

would say. But but yeah, teenagers everybody. Let's say let's say a child that doesn't
use social media. I can do that. Can I take that. A a a child
or an adult who doesn't use social media. Can I Can I explain it now.
Let's take that. Okay, sounds good. Um, so when you have a relationship with a
bank, they control your money and whether or not you can have it. When you
have something called decentralized finance, you control your money and the thing that you use
for what a bank does just gives you a service,

just provides a certain service to you. like it gives you a return on your
money or it securely allows you to interact with it for certain key things that
you want to do like move it around or some other things, but it doesn't
control it. So, the difference is whether you want to put your money in a
bank run by a bunch of people you don't know and that could do crazy
stuff with it, which happens a lot, or if you want to control your money
and put it in a system that can only behave

in certain very specific ways. And that's that's the that's the big difference in risk.
And I I personally think that once everyone understands this difference and once there's a
few more bank failures, which unfortunately I think we're going towards with the global economic
crisis that's to come and the kind of devaluation of fiat currency, a whole bunch
of other fun stuff that's going to going to be happening unfortunately, then then the
relationship that I just described will be quite valuable, right. Like go ask go ask
somebody who you know lost their money from some kind

of bank failure or something. Are you interested in in in this in this in
this uh feature. They'll be like yeah it's the best feature I ever heard of.
Like how how do I how do I get that. So that's, you know, that's
what I think we're going towards because, yeah, the world's not gonna, I don't see
how the world can be more stable. Like everything is just becoming unbelievably unstable now.
unstable now. People are doubting fiat currency. There's multiple wars. Even within society, people are,
you know, freaking out about their different opinions on, you

know, is this the color green or is this the color purple. What color is
it. Who knows. Like, let's let's go crazy. What's the color, man. It's important. Like,
let's do it, guys. Time to gear up on this one. Um, so you know,
things are not going to get more stable here. Unfortunately, Unfortunately, Unfortunately, that's not going
to happen. As it gets more unstable, people want control. So, our industry gives them
control. You mentioned, is this color green or is it purple. it purple. How do
you define truth. How do I define truth. Well, there's

a little bit of a a little bit of a problem with that. Um, because
you have objectivity, then you have like subjectivity. Subjectivity is is is is kind of,
you know, my perception your perception. So, there's a subjective version of truth where we
all agree to call this green, therefore it's green. But can you objectively mathematically prove
what green is. I you know the these are very complicated questions usually without good
answers. Uh, interestingly enough, the project of of the the Stoics, some of the people
I quoted was to use mathematics to prove certain ethical

truths and over the entrance to their um to their, you know, the Platonic kind
of school, you had something about how math will prove things or math will, you
know, tell you the truth or something like that. So, people people have been looking
for a mathematically guaranteed way to prove things for for quite a while. Um, even
blockchains, just to be clear, that's a that's node operators that cryptographically run a agreed
upon protocol. But even that blockchain transaction is an agreed upon truth. It's just like
a a very cryptographically guaranteed agreed upon truth that it

becomes very very hard for you to roll back or disagree with. So it becomes
essentially like mathematically guaranteed guaranteed guaranteed objective truth. That's a really complicated topic. I I
looked into that topic and it is very very complicated to uh to truly define
what you know what objectivity means. objectivity means. And uh for that type of thing,
you probably have to talk to mathematicians and physicists and physicists and physicists because they're
the closest on that one and they don't even agree. So I I think there's
uh there's a lot of subjective truth and and we

can make a system where we agree on on what what a truth would be.
That's partly what our system does is it actually allows you to set conditions and
to say um we pre-agree that if these five weather system stations all say that
it rained then it rained and so we've agreed upon pre-agreed upon a subjective truth
about that right and then we've said okay we will connect that oracle network with
a smart contract smart contract smart contract and we will allow that to control value
because that's our agreed upon truth. So Oracle networks and

chain link are are a way I would say the leading way right now to
agree upon a definition of truth but it's agreed upon right and and the only
people who need to agree upon that truth by the way are the counterparties. M
M M so if you're the insurance company and I'm the farmer and you show
me hey you know I'm going to I'm going to verify rainfall against these five
different data systems and then I have this smart contract that's going to pay you
out according to that then we've agreed we've agreed what

truth is in this context and there needs to be a system that'll enforce that
whether it's for a derivatives transaction whether it's for uh DeFi lending you know that
That that's kind of what what Shainlink does. And that's what you call definitive truth.
Which one Which one Which one is this. What you call definitive truth. The concept
of definitive truth. You define truth and then you you automate it through these smart
contracts. contracts. I think there's another word before definitive. I don't remember what it is.
That's a term we we've used in a little in

a little while. But yeah, that's I think it's like cryptographically defined truth or something.
Basically, yeah, that's that's that's the idea. The the idea is that you and me
can sit down and we can define what the truth is between us and then
we can codify it, but we don't codify it in a blockchain because a blockchain
can't verify things for us outside of itself. So, a blockchain can verify the code
we put into it in a very specific language. And it can verify private key
signatures like I signed and you signed and it can

verify that and then if those two signatures hit a smart contract that says if
I get two signatures then I'll do something. It can do that but it can't
verify can't verify can't verify something between two chains. It can't verify an identity. It
can't verify a market price. Can't verify the weather. It can't verify anything outside of
itself. M itself. M so chain link is is the system where you codify what
you're going to verify and then you use that verification to trigger you know value
and and other key things on chains basically you said

I read somewhere transparency creates accountability creates accountability creates accountability can you explain yeah so
if if I have uh a banking system and the banking system is going to
prove to you what's solvent every year through an audit. Then you have an a
year, there's a year in which something can go wrong. And if I can get
through that audit and kind of, you know, manipulate it and get two years and
do that two years in a row, I can do three years. There's a lot
of weird that can happen that in that time span.

On the other hand, let's say you have an Oracle network verifying network verifying network
verifying what your reserves are for a stable coin, for example. And the Oracle network
has a way to stop any minting of any new stable coins if the reserves
aren't there. Well, how of how quickly can it do it. Well, it could do
it every second. Well, now you went from a few years to a second. second.
And I mean, I think it's probably pretty hard to do a lot of crazy
in one second. M second. M so generally speaking that's

that's that's that's a great example of you know coming to you know a kind
of defined truth that in this case would be proof of reserves and saying I'm
going to prove the reserves of my stable coin or or my tokenized fund or
asset or whatever and I'm going to prove that to you every second second second
and now I I would feel pretty I would feel good about that. I would
feel better about that thing than I feel about, you know, something somewhere that's getting
audited once a year like a Bernie Maid off or

a wire card or something or Enron or you know these things. these things. And
you mentioned before I mean for example these audits right once a year and it's
not only you mentioned a couple of example frauds complete frauds right straight up frauds
but you also talked about the fact that people and institution especially at scale are
not necessarily comp competent do we say that that that competent competent competent so it's
not necessarily only hey how do we prevent a bunch of frauds from happening it's
also when things become too big or when people are

being set that that that oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah uh roles that they
that they're not competent this can have massive I mean we saw the example recently
with credit for example right it's not necessarily it's not necessarily without having to go
into conspiration theories that some people did wrong things on purpose but you just have
this huge organization that just don't know what's going on anymore and because there's no
transparency Yeah. Because it's not automated, right. You have all these people making decisions. Sometimes
people make, you know, really malicious decisions like Wire Card

or Bernie Maidoff. Maidoff. And sometimes, in my opinion, some of these things are so
poorly run that they just fail. And and and and and here's the thing, right.
They never look poorly run. Silicon Valley Bank didn't look poorly run until, you know,
it went into, you know, receiverhip and you had like someone had to buy it
out. Credit Swiss didn't seem poorly run until UBS had to rescue it, rescue it,
rescue it, which UBS had to be rescued by the Swiss Confederation in 2008. So,
it's the same happening over and over again. Look, and

I don't have anything against these these institutions. Like, I I think these institutions are
following a pattern of many institutions. I'm I'm just saying that there's the thing I
was saying before was that there's a lot of people who are saying that there's
a lot of institutions conspiring against them and many of the institutions are unable to
do their day-to-day work and just operate. And so what what I think what what
I think we should do is we should take blockchains and smart contracts and oracle
networks and AI should combine all this stuff and we

should create a state of hyperamation. hyperamation. But that hyperamation has to be really reliable.
So for example, we have AI oracle networks where we eliminate significant amounts of hallucinations
where you run the AI model in multiple nodes, you compare their results and you
discard the results that deviate from from a certain quorum or or consensus. So what
our industry is really good at doing is generating consensus consensus consensus and and proving
that something happened in a really reliable way. Whether that's a blockchain transaction with a
blockchain or whether that's an oracle network report or input

and a verification of something else. AI is is is going to be really useful
for that. But but but but we're really just going into this um world of
hyperautomation hyperautomation hyperautomation and and and mathematically and technically driven hyperamation is is is in
many many ways much more reliable than people than people than people and and that's
what that's what'll solve a lot of these problems like like back to these points
if if you could prove on a real-time basis what the holdings of Silicon Valley
Bank were that wouldn't have happened. If if you could

prove what the solveny and the reserves and and the capital conditions of wire card
was would have been impossible to happen. So it actually protects you against both. It
protects you against the malicious uh you know institutional bad actor which is not as
common as people think. People think that's really common. That's actually not that common because
you know we think about this a lot from the point of view of stopping
it, right. right. How do you build systems to to make that not possible. And
then the much more common one is that the institution

just was not good enough to mitigate a risk and they didn't share information internally
or externally. I think it's Balaji who was I mean he was he just understand
things very early on before most people and uh he talked about the banking crisis
actually during the banking crisis when he did his one billion $1 million bet on
bitcoin I think it was just purely to make people like realize hey the banking
system is right and he was saying every institution is is uh underwater and so
if we had this system or a lot right so

the the question is I mean we don't need we don't need an answer but
people trust right people trust this big building people trust the this suit people trust
this nice car of the banker and so on and so forth but now if
we apply all these systems that uh chaining is developing and other people are developing
in the crypto world to the traditional finance world probably we're going to see a
lot more of these malfunctions malfunctions malfunctions or problems or problems or problems than we
imagine or that than we could even think or guess.

I mean, I I think we're unfortunately we're going towards something a little bit different.
I I think what we're going to um find is that there is no lender
of last resort. So, so the the the people that have been bailing out all
these banks, let's imagine that governments need to get bailed out. There's nobody above governments.
governments. So I I think what we're arriving to now unfort unfortunately for you know
the vast majority of society with the exception of a few people that are able
to to foresee and prepare and and and get get

in a position to to to to relate to this risk in the right way
is basically fiat currency and and banks uh not even banks, central bank and and
kind of government levels of solveny of solveny of solveny are going to are going
to be coming more and more into question. So the amount of people that are
now discussing the US debt, debt, debt, the amount of people that are understanding what
the ratio of debt to GDP means, the amount of people that are that are
understanding how you get out of this through economic growth

and that you know maybe the AIdriven economic growth is one of the few things
that could do it but then that'll lead to mass unemployment and that'll lead to
its own kind of economic decline and reset. reset. Basically, I think banking related crisis
is going to be the least of people's problems and and there is also going
to be that crisis. Um there's there's going to be like I think think think
a crisis of faith in basically almost everything. and and and that's when cryptographically guaranteed
things, assets, ownership, control will be very valuable. What's your

timeline on that. I'm not I'm not good at predicting pred predicting that, but at
the rate things are accelerating, I'd be surprised if that didn't happen before 2030. before
2030. I I I think before 2030, you know, I mean, how much money can
you print. How much how much jet debt to GDP ratio are are people willing
to deal with. Like how much unemployment are are people willing to deal with. How
much inflation are people willing to deal with. deal with. I don't think they're they're
willing to deal with that much more. could be wrong

about that. I don't understand how the debt to debt to GDP ratio is where
it is for for for most most things right now. And I I think what
we're coming to is there's like this hundred-year experiment now more or less about 100
years maybe 80 90 years depending how you count it of of getting getting away
from gold as a as something that fundamentally backs things basically starting from you know
the great depression. depression. So this there's this there's basically just been this nice big
experiment of like fiat money. Talking about system, you mentioned

a couple of times smart contracts before. Can you explain smart contracts to an adult
who doesn't use social media. An adult who doesn't use social media. We can find
one of those. Um I still have hope. Well, that makes one of us. Um
sorry, I'm just kidding. Uh, let me let me think. What am I explaining to
this adult who doesn't use social media. Smart contracts Smart contracts Smart contracts simply no
jargon. Smart contracts are ma mathematical guarantees guarantees guarantees about what you own and your
relationship with others. with others. So instead of you trusting

some system somewhere, you give the rights for something to work relative to you to
this smart contract and it will always in a guaranteed way execute what you agreed
to with it. So if you and me make a smart contract that under a
certain condition you get paid or I get paid, it'll happen 100% of the time
regardless of what you and me want to do. Once we enter into it, it's
not based on the legal system. It's not based on me, me and you wanting
to do it. It's not based on anyone in anywhere

deciding whether it happens. It's mathematically guaranteed. It's guaranteed that's going to happen. What's the
biggest problem with smart contracts today. contracts today. That they don't connect outside, which is
the problem we work on. What is an an oracle. Explain simply, no jargon. And
Oracle connects the smart contracts to all the stuff outside that they need to work
with in order to do valuable things. valuable things. Can you give me an example
of stuff outside. I mean before you mentioned the weather and weather and weather and
entrances. I mean market prices, connectivity between chains, um connection

to traditional financial systems, all this type of stuff. You're the founder and CEO of
Chain Link. I'm the co-founder co-founder and CEO of Chainlink. Chainlink Labs. I'm the co-founder
uh and CEO of Chain Link Labs. Link Labs. What is Chain Link. Explain simply.
No jargon. I like that too much. Works. We're trying to We're trying to educate
the masses and the people who don't understand crypto. Well, makes sense. Um, no jar
is smart contracts a jargon term. I mean, we define it now, so it's fine.
It's fine. Okay, good. Chain link is a platform for

enabling next generation smart contracts smart contracts smart contracts that connect all of the world's
transactions into a single internet of contracts where you and me can mathematically guarantee our
relationship. Whether that's a banking relationship, whether that's a trading relationship, whether that's a insurance
relationship, whether it's a purchase of concert tickets. So chain link is is the platform
that enables that to work for these advanced smart contract use cases. Without chain link,
you can't build these advanced smart contracts. And basically, you're you're stuck with just making
tokens that don't do much. You started chaining eight years

ago. 2017. In 2017. What's something that still frustrates you after building chaining for eight
years. That you can't automate people. You have you have to deal with people. People
are are the most difficult uh thing to deal with. You know, I'm a big
fan of automation. But the the the most complicated thing about building anything really is
is is going to end up being dealing with people. That's that's really what it
boils down to. Like if you have thousands of people, if you have hundreds of
people, if you have users, if you have all these

folks. So I don't think that's that's going to change. That's a weird answer, though.
No, no, no, it's not. But it it leads me to another question. I'm not
sure you're going to answer too, but cuz I completely agree on the people's side.
I mean, you I I run businesses, very small businesses, but it's a nightmare. It's
a nightmare and it comes from I I can't wait till I just have to
deal with AI and all all these people all these people can just deal with
AI and then if the AI gives me a solid

like 20 30 years where it just doesn't try to kill all the people like
that'll be a decent that'll be a decent thing. That's going to be great. I'm
looking forward to that. If it's so hard to deal with people, how do you
manage personal relationships. Where do you find the patience. My view is that many people
don't have clear and accurate information. Usually when people have the same information, information, information,
they will after psy like cycling on it enough, they'll come to the same conclusion.
Some people will cycle very quickly and some people will

cycle very slowly. But if you spend enough time and you and me have the
same information, eventually we will cycle to the same conclusion. conclusion. The problem is that
there's information kind of asymmetries between people because of their uh educational differences, because of
their access to information. Uh sometimes people discount information because of biases. So they receive
the information but they don't really receive the information because of biases basically. And and
that's actually the problem. That's usually the problem, right. Is that you can explain something
to people once once once and they forget or you

explain it twice and they have a bias and you know they hear something else.
or or or maybe you didn't have the right information. information. But but my experience
really is that once you really clearly logically lay out a choice as a rational
economic actor, which is basically what economics is about, everyone makes the same choice. That's
what economics is about actually. Like like this example I gave you of I have,
you know, control over something versus I don't have control over something. If you really
really define that in like hyper clear terms and all

the banks in the world are are failing, what is what are the majority of
people going to do. They're going to find a way where they where they can
manage things in a way that they reduce that risk. Like once you and me
get on the same page about that scenario and the relevant information and the relevant
assumptions, the answer's pretty obvious. The answer is this, right. The and and why don't
people have that perspective. Well, they haven't considered all that information, right. Either no one's
talked to them about it or they haven't taken time

to do that or they don't think it's relevant or whatever collection of things. You
see, but but that's the world that we're that we're building for. Um I think
in our industry is the world where systems outside our industry are unreliable and people
will choose our industry as the reliable set of systems. And that's that's a good
example. Like when you think about it, that makes perfect sense. at least to me
I think to you and you know I' I've had that conversation with many many
people over the years and what I've noticed is once

you you're you're you're on you're you're sharing the same information everyone's like yeah obviously
like why why would I want to take risk on a counterparty if all the
counterparties are blown up all around me I I I don't I don't need more
risk in my life like I'm fine without it I I'll I'll take this thing
so you know this thing that that's cryptographically guaranteed cryptographically guaranteed cryptographically guaranteed So So
So that that's what's difficult, right. Because people show up and they and they and
and they go on social media or they go wherever

they go and they like they go crazy. They lose their They just go crazy.
It's like they they have these ideas and and if you sit down with them
and and you were to take all this time, which I don't do. I don't
do this but like some people do, right. And they like dissect their ideas. They
go like, "Okay, why do you believe this and why do you believe that. And
what's your assumption here and what's your assumption there. assumption there. Sometimes what you really
find is like there is no information like they don't

have information. They don't have a reason for an assumption. So I I think the
the difficult thing with people is is how they relate to information and their own
theories. And And And that's what creates most of the problems is is people have
this different information. Like someone thinks something's good, someone thinks something's bad or they're using
different words. That's an example of a huge information asymmetry that happens all the time.
Like I'm saying a word and you're saying a word. We mean the same thing,
but your word is different from my word and I

think you're saying something different than me. You and I you think I'm saying something
different than you. It's just it's just a crazy information asymmetry, right. and now we're
arguing even though we're saying the same thing. That's the most difficult thing. And so,
you know, that's that's it. What's your biggest achievement with chain link today. Making the
DeFi boom happen. That's that's what that's what made chain link chain link in the
in the beginning is that there was there was this industry 10 or 15 teams,
less than 100 million in TVL. These teams were running

around trying to solve the Oracle problem Oracle problem Oracle problem which is which in
that case was verification of market data into their smart contracts and basically that's that's
an example of a fantastic market pulling a problem out of us. So there was
there was like nobody there was literally nobody making what's called Oracle networks. We basically
invented that. There were people that had individual private oracles where like you would trust
them to run the oracle for you, but then you're seating control to them, right.
Which is not the point of DeFi. The point of

DeFi is that you are able to be you you're you're getting guaranteed guaranteed guaranteed
that the DeFi contract can't manipulate or or kind of deviate in a in a
variable way from from what it's supposed to do, right. So it can't deviate and
and for a DeFi contract to give you that guarantee, that means the oracle doesn't
deviate and the contract doesn't deviate. deviate. But there were no oracle networks. There were
blockchain networks that guaranteed the reliability of the contract. But there was not nothing like
an oracle network, which is what we in the chain

community invented. community invented. And so it was fantastic, right. It was just amazing. Like
you you literally went from 10 15 teams to hundreds to thousands of teams. You
went from uh something less than hund00 million as an industry to 200 billion. That's
unbelievable growth. unbelievable growth. Like if you compare that to the size of certain industries
like the gaming industry, industry, industry, I don't know. I don't remember how much it
is. it is. I think it's two to three billion. The whole gaming whole gaming
whole gaming the whole gaming industry. All gaming. Two to

300. Everything. Online casinos, poker, uh AAA titles, MMOs, everything. Mind-blowing. That industry. How long
it take to get to get gaming to to 2003 300 billion. It took like
decades. like decades. DeFi went from less than 100 million to 200 billion in like
what three years. Crazy crazy speed. And so then um me and and our community
are just like trying to keep up with demand. So it's this it's this insane
situation where we we end up launching over a thousand oracle networks. So if you
think about that, think about that in the context of

blockchain networks and L2s. Let's imagine that each L2 in a family of chains or
each L3 in in some family of chains is a network and we launched over
a thousand networks on production. And those thousand plus networks powered that industry to over
200 billion. 200 billion. But but then what what we had to do is we
had to figure out what else do oracle networks do. So that that was an
amazing fantastic achievement and I'm deeply grateful to our community, deeply grateful to all the
DeFi users that work with us. It's it's amazing to

be part of having something like that happen and grow like that. That was just
it's amazing and it's addictive and it's just like the the the the best feeling
to to be part of making something something big like that happen. M uh that
was fantastic. And so then I think we we in the chainlink community and myself
and a number of other other key people got hooked on that and then we
were like let's do it again. And then we we did it partly with random
numbers for NFTTS and gaming. Then we did it with

uh crosschain computation these other capabilities we have. Now we're on the process of doing
it in the trady capital markets community. And what I'm what I'm hoping to see
there is huge amounts of liquidity coming into our industry with the help of all
these different chain link services. But but that's what a lot of successful things are
built on really. They're built on like these huge industry growing successes. So but but
the DeFi community and and chain link in the in the in like the history
of DeFi in the early days I think will be

inexurably linked now. and I'm I'm really grateful for for for having the opportunity to
be part of that. What's your biggest problem at Chaining today. I mean, Chainlink has
as a community and as as a number of companies in Chainlink Labs itself, it's
gotten to be a lot of people. M people. M that all have to work
together and it comes down to this information asymmetry and coordination problem of basically how
do thousands of people end up working together in an efficient way where everyone's always
working on the right thing in the right order because

chain link does so many different things now. It does crosschain, it does data, it
does identity, it does compliance, it does uh legacy systems integration, it does like so
many things. there's gonna be more things and all of these things need to work
together and there's more things that need to happen beyond that, right. So, it's it's
it's almost controlling not controlling or it's almost making sure that the evolution of chain
link can happen in a thoughtful way. I mean, it's it's a lot easier when
you have fewer people coming together to make a solution.

And this is really the problem of all big ecosystems and companies and groups of
companies in an ecosystem. It's it's them working together to do something that is consistently
useful and valuable. But I think the chain link ecosystem does this really really well
actually. We um but but it's it's always going to be a problem. This is
this is going to be the biggest problem. For example, in in the in in
the case of Mastercard, uh that was actually a collaboration between Mastercard, between Mastercard, between
Mastercard, Zero Hash, Shift 4, Uniswap, and Swapper, which is

a chain link ecosystem company. And all those companies had to work together using chain
link to coordinate the the transaction from the from the Mastercard side back onto the
onchain side to get a token from a DEX, right. And that's only possible when
when all those people can work together because otherwise that implementation can't exist can't exist
can't exist because it it has to have all these groups working together. And so
that that's that's the challenging thing. It's it's actually getting an ecosystem of um of
these different groups to work together well and and to

provide value together. together. Chaining announced a partnership with Mastercard. Mastercard. What does that sort
of partnership concretely mean for chain link, for crypto, and for the world. So, what
it what it shows is is actually that the Mastercard payment network that has over
three and a half billion card holders can now on production live allow those card
holders to buy a token directly from their Mastercard purchase. So they actually don't need
an intermediary anymore to buy that token. Before you would have had somebody you have
to make an account somewhere and you have to like

have a relationship with something and you and you deal with them for the masterard
payment. Now the master card directly buys the token through a system of transactions and
verifications and those transactions and verifications are now basically your intermediary. But that is a
mathematically guaranteed intermediary. The the you're mathematically guaranteeing that once your masterard transaction reaches a
certain point, it will result in a blockchain based event which will exchange well initially
you exchange the masterard uh transaction for a stable coin. The stable coin is then
programmatically sent to a DEX and in which it exchanges

the stable coin for the token and then the token is sent to your wallet.
But that's a mathematically guaranteed flow directly from your Mastercard relationship going through, you know,
a certain amount of steps, but mathematically guaranteed steps. steps. And so that's a big
deal for two reasons. It it smooths out the user experience and the speed with
which a Mastercard user which is 3. 5 billion users which is what I was
talking about before like go and find me something else that can give you access
to 3. 5 billion users other other than a few

messaging apps in China you're not going to find much right so it's it's pretty
significant a that something with that big of a user base wants to do this
it's pretty significant that we can technically make it work in this cryptographically guaranteed way.
And I think it's it's also significant because because because this is a pattern that'll
then be seen by all the other institutions similar to Mastercard and they'll be like,
"Wow, I got to do that. I got to get involved because because because I
have to get my users interacting with crypto and blockchains

as well. " And and that's what I was speaking about in the beginning of
this thing where it's like if I go to you and I explain to you
with clear information, what would what do you find valuable if your preferences are, you
know, the growth of this industry. What you find valuable is more users with more
capital. So, so great news. Here's 3. 5 billion users with huge amounts of capital
that can now, you know, deal with crypto in a in a very efficient, secure,
reliable way for them. And and that's what Chainlink is

just going to be doing and the chain community is going to be doing again
and again and again and again. uh whether that's institutional users, whether that's retail users
through the credit cards, whether that's other payment systems, whether that's data sources that are
needed to make those transactions work, whether it's identity systems. Chainlink's role is really to
enable all of this. Now, uh and the more it enables, I think the more
our industry can can can grow. The one book that got me down the Bitcoin
rabbit hole is called the Bitcoin standard by Safamus. What

is the chain link standard. Sure. So the chain link standard is a set of
protocols to solve these different problems that I've defined for you. It's basically the ability
to connect data into blockchains, connect identity into blockchains, connect blockchains between each other, connect
blockchains to, you know, payment systems like Mastercard. In the internet, you have certain standards
like TCP IP, SSL, HTTPS, HTTP, all these different standards. These standards are the underlying
agreed upon ways for transactions to work. And what what chain link does is it
creates these standards for the blockchain industry. So if my

chain and your chain want to communicate, what's the standard way to do that. If
your D5 protocol needs a piece of data and I need to know that the
way your protocol is using data is secure for me to put money into your
D5 protocol, what's that. What's the standard way to do that. If I need to
prove my identity to you for in your protocol for your protocol to be able
to accept my money from my chain to your chain, what's the standardized way that
everyone says is legally correct is reliable to prove that

identity to you. And and standards are are generally things that people don't want to
deal with. What standards are are the type of thing that when they're working, people
aren't thinking about them. So So in the internet, for example, nobody thinks about TCP
IP. Nobody's like, "Do I use this version of TCP IP or that version of
TCP IP. Does my server support the right version of TCP IP. It's not a
problem, right. You spin up a server on Google Cloud. I spin up a server
on AWS. We connect them. No problem, right. But in

our industry, it's this crazy thing, right. It's like bridge hacks and all this wacky
stuff. in in in in in in the normal world I want to pipe data
into a server into into some computation solve problem in our industry other than chain
link people still experience Oracle hacks why why are these problems even even something that
like should they shouldn't exist shouldn't exist shouldn't exist and and that's what the standards
do so the standards say like look if you want to deal with data here's
how you do it if you want to go across

chain here's how you do it if you want to prove identity here's how you
do it if you want comply with certain regulations on accounting or proving other things
on chain like proof of reserves. Here's how you do it. And the value of
that is that when people see you do it that way, it's no longer a
question for them. And so chain link uh right now powers the majority of DeFi.
So that standard in DeFi has been widely adopted. Now that standard is getting adopted
in Tradfi. Tradfi. And if DeFi and Trafi adopt the

same standard for how they connect between chains, for how they prove things to each
other about the value of something through price, through how they prove identity, through all
these, you know, critical problems that blockchains don't solve, but that they need to have
solved in order for transactions to happen. If both DeFi and Tradfy are on the
same standard, then actually the seamless merging of DeFi and Tradfi just happens. Because if
if I'm if if I'm a client of some big bank and your D5 protocol
is now able to meet my compliance requirements, requirements, requirements,

I as a client of that big bank can send $100 million into your D5
protocol because you're connected to CCIP. My bank is connected to CCIP. your your protocol
accepts uh identity proofs from the chain link kind of identity standard and my bank
can send my identity proofs over to you in that way. your asset is valued
against chain link data feeds or streams and the bank that I have my value
in is willing to accept that your contract works correctly enough to provide me value
without me having to call call them up and ask

them you know why the thing I bought isn't accurately reflected in its value because
the price is correct right and so that's it right my my ability to transact
with you as a DeFi protocol just became unbelievably easy And now what happens is
my liquidity from this institution flows to you, the DeFi protocol. And and now you're
very happy, right. Because your D5 protocol just got a hund00 million from a single
user, whereas before from a retail user, you used to get a dollar or $1,000,
or $1,000, or $1,000, but now you got a hund00

million from one user. And see, this is what I mean about information. If you
go to people in DeFi and you ask them and you explain all this, all
this, all this, they they'll be faced with a dilemma. They'll be like, "I've been
talking about getting rid of the banks. " But on the other hand, if you
know a bank user wants to give me $100 million, you know, you know, you
know, give me the money. I'm I'm okay with that. I'm I'm feeling good about
that. And And how many of those users did you

say you have. You have $4 trillion. Oh, that's interesting. So, you're telling me that
if you if if your users send me a very small percentage of what they
have, I'll become like the leading DeFi protocol in my in my subset of DeFi.
DeFi. I see. Well, I think maybe we should talk more and and find a
way to get, you know, a portion of that 4 trillion into my DeFi protocol.
So, you see, this is where this is going. This is this is an inevitable
thing. as as as long as you know the money

is over there and this place is driven by money and you know the money's
definitely over there and this place over here is definitely driven by money. So you
know that's the idea. Chain link has a market share of 80% or over 80%
on Ethereum. Uh majority of decentralized finance space and you mentioned now that you're I'm
not sure it's the right word but uh taking over the entire traditional finance world.
finance world. That's the right word. How does chaining take over the entire traditional finance
world. by providing secure, reliable systems that allow people to

get to market sooner and generate value for them and their clients. their clients. So,
so the the the secure and reliable guarantees that chain link provides, no other similar
system provides. They just don't provide. We can go through every single system and we
can explain this system got hacked for 300 million. This system has no private key
security at all. It's probably going to get hacked soon. this system has you know
these other six problems and actually the individual independent audits of these systems keep finding
the same thing basically in their in their audits they're

like oh your system has these risks risks risks here's chain link CCIP doesn't have
any of these risks and the D5 protocols some of them you know move quickly
and sometimes they don't realize this but the trady people they they really realize this
and they really care about this so the first thing is secure reliable systems. reliable
systems. The second thing is providing value to these institutions. these institutions. And what does
what does that mean. Well, it means it means two things. It means they can
get to market quickly. You can get to market with

limited complexity. How does how does that look. Well, chain link's ready to go. Chain
links already connected into a bunch of your counterparties chains. Chainlink's already connected into the
data sources that you want to use as a traditional financial institution. Chain link is
connected into your identity systems and uh sources. Chain link is connected into your messaging
system for swift messages or or what whatever else you want to do. So chain
link is ready to go. By the way, everything I just said, there is no
other platform right now that does all that. You you

you can find an oracle somewhere that'll give you some data un unreliably. You can
find some oracle somewhere that'll give you some crosschain probably in a very insecure way.
You can find some or you can cook up some oracle that might connect you
to an identity system. There is no platform where you can do all of those
things. And even if you combined all three of those things, your counterparty would probably
have a very big problem with one or two of them because they wouldn't want
to trust it. So your your challenge is how do

I build a highly reliable tradfi transaction. How do I build that trady transaction in
an efficient way for me which means I want it all in one platform and
then how do I show that tradfi flow workflow back to my counterparty so that
they're willing to accept it. M and so chain link is the only thing that
does that and so you're going to get to market you're going to be secure
and reliable and you're going to be able to build it all in one system.
The the really crazy thing is is is is the

chain link runtime environment. So the chain link runtime environment is a super next level
thing that you know if that works then it's going to be pretty mind-blowing because
because developers are going to go from building these advanced smart contracts over the course
of like months or weeks to days or hours which is which is the type
of thing that Ethereum did for the early days of smart contracts. But now the
smart contracts have become so unbelievably complicated that you can't really build a smart contract
on any one chain. You have to build a smart

contract across multiple chains with multiple oracles connecting it to multiple systems. And the CRA
is going to really simplify that I think at least that's what what what we're
seriously pushing for now. And there's already a number of institutions using the CRA uh
some of which we've announced with. So it's pretty uh pretty serious stuff. So the
idea is not only to be extremely strong on the technological side but now that
we if we're very practical thinking okay where is the where are the flows coming
traditional finance traditional finance traditional finance how do we get

these people in we need someone in that case chain link to almost build you
might not like the comparison but some people say AWS of crypto of web 3
but or I would I would go further and say Microsoft. And why do would
I say Microsoft. Because they're everywhere. everywhere. They're everywhere. And so if if uh and
some people might not like a Microsoft might say it's old school, whatever. But like
if someone makes a decision in a big institution, big institution, big institution, they're probably
going to go with Microsoft because it's everywhere. They won't

get fired for it and because they're everywhere already and because they're integrated with a
lot of different things. And so we need someone in crypto who is building that
to bring this traditional finance people with a traditional mind mindset into our world. Yeah,
I think a lot of that sounds right. I I would look at it more
from the point of view of like Linux and the the ability to have an
open- source standard that everyone everyone uses, but the difference is that it's like a
collection of Linux and SS uh SSL, you know, the

HTTPS kind of security and TCP IP. M IP. M so it's actually a combination
of all those things those things those things and then there's a lot of value
that can be created by building all kinds of infrastructure and services on top of
those standards. So, so the way to think about it is that chain link is
is first and and foremost this set of standards. It's a set of protocols to
define how this happens. And that's where there's this very big network effect, right. Where
if if you and me adopt this protocol and then

someone else adopts it, now there's three people using it. So now someone else can
work with three people. The fourth one adopts it, there's four people now. And so
there's this there's this growing and growing network effect where every incremental additional adopter of
the standard makes the standard more valuable whether that's the data standard whether that's the
crosschain standard whether that's the identity standard and the standards will get adopted more and
more because these standards can work together. So for example in in the identity side
we have something called CCID the crosschain ID. So the

CCID is a way to move identity information crosschain but you couldn't make that work
unless you had CCIP which is the crosschain interoperability protocol and then after you move
the identity you still need data right so the protocols can be made to work
together in very useful ways the adoption of the protocols and the standard grows standard
grows standard grows and then you get into this world that you described of like
the Microsoft or the AWS where someone is building infrastructure on those standards Some of
that infrastructure is built by Chain Labs. Some of that

infrastructure is built by teams like Space and Time in in the in the Chainlink
ecosystem. Some of that infrastructure in the Mastercard example was built by Swapper. That's a
chain link ecosystem company for example. So there's other companies now building that infrastructure on
those standards. And every additional company that builds the infrastructure and a service on those
standards drives more and more adoption of the standards. and and and that's where um
I think chain link is going to excel and where my answer to your question
about making that ecosystem grow and work together. But we're

we're doing that right. We have space and time swapper a lot of other great
ecosystem companies that are successfully building on top of the chain link protocol and achieving
real things with real users like achieving real outcomes with real institutions not to mention
the DeFi community where where that happens regularly. So that that's really you know how
I would think about the the chain link standard and and chain link and then
what what happens is that you know the revenue from all that flows in to
those uh services and the standard because you have to

you know pay some amount of money to use the official standard and to have
it uh implemented correctly. You mentioned a bunch of time the chaining community chaining community
chaining community that you're very grateful I am very grateful. Yes. grateful. Chain link has
one of the most vibrant communities in crypto that we call the link marines. link
marines. How did all these people come together to rally behind the chain link mission
when in your own words the details of what chaining is doing aren't particularly sexy
because it's backend tech that end users will never notice.

I think we got really lucky is is basically what happened. Uh I think people
understood what we were doing because we were the first ones to ever do it.
Like I said, we invented Oracle Networks and there was enough people in the crypto
community that understood that without what we were doing, you weren't going to get DeFi
to grow. You weren't going to get these next waves of innovation in our industry.
And basically we got lucky that you know they're they're a bunch of these people.
They're understanding what we do because they understand the significance

of it. They understand that we're the only ones doing it. We were the only
ones doing it I think for a year or a year and a half after
launch. So anyone who was interested in what we were doing like genuinely interested they
would just naturally join the chain community. And then uh I think we delivered on
a lot of things. So we delivered on making DeFi go to the next level.
We delivered on providing random numbers to the NFT trend and the blockchain gaming trend.
We delivered on a number of things after that. And

that ability to deliver as a community and as a protocol and as a standard
and as a set of and a set of infrastructures infrastructures infrastructures gave people excitement
about this being a real thing that it wasn't just an idea. And a lot
of people put in huge amounts of effort, myself and many others to to deliver
on that. And so that's that's the the the the subset of the of the
community that kind of delivered on on on you know making DeFi grow and and
providing those and launching those thousand plus oracle networks. But

then there's another subset of the community that did a lot of education, explained the
value of oracles, explained why the security of oracles is important, and a lot of
their explanations and views were validated because that ended up being true because a bunch
of other people that didn't use chain link got hacked. And so what what you
arrived at was you arrived at a group of people that you know want to
see the crypto industry grow, want to see DeFi succeed, understand that chain link plays
a critical role in that, understand that chain link is

properly securing uh the majority of DeFi even to this day, are excited about that,
want to be part of that and want to help in whatever way they can.
Whether that's educating people, whether that's helping build, whether that's building a service on top
of chain link like Space and Time or Swapper or others. And all of those
people have a unique and and valuable and important contribution that they're making to the
standard, right. Some of them are explaining how the standard works and why the security
and reliability of the standard is important. Some of them

are helping build the standard. Some of them are building pieces of infrastructure and services
on top of the standard and making it easier to consume for specific use cases
that now are in in this standard which feeds the network effect of that as
a standard. And so I'm I'm extremely lucky because something like this, you know, it
can't it can't be done by by just a small group of people like you
need a community of people to do all those things things things and uh to
resist the naysayers and and to to kind of push

it forward. So that is something I'm I'm extremely grateful for. I myself have not
spent um a ton of time uh you know informing or speaking with a community
that much and and my reason for that is because I don't really think that
that's the way in which I can add value. So so me speaking to the
community every single day is is not really the thing that I think will provide
the biggest value. I think the way that I can provide value is giving feedback
on certain key you know technical things, meeting and working

with certain key users like uh you know Mastercard and with people in the ecosystem
to make sure that everyone is working well to to get things moving in the
right direction. And so I'm just optimizing for spending time on the things that matter
versus the things that don't. So, I'm I'm I'm even I'm even more lucky in
that sense is that in that I think the community sees that and they and
they see that there's a lot of people working on the things that actually matter
instead of spending all this time kind of talking to

them about stuff. So, I'm very very lucky and grateful. Yeah, that was my next
one. What's your message to the link marines. But I think I think you answered
what's one of the absolute hardest problems that every network founder faces network founder you
mean as in like building an a blockchain network Oracle network. network. [Music] [Music] [Music]
It's it's getting a first killer use case case case that that's the hardest things
to thing to do because you can you can build like for for chain link
that was DeFi and then that gave us the the

traction and and the and the legitimacy and the excitement to build all the other
use cases for for Ethereum. I think it was ICOs ICOs ICOs and token sales
uh as as a concept because the ICO boom kind of you know made it
worthwhile to go on Ethereum and and and launch a token and that was very
difficult in other places and it was very very very doable on Ethereum. I think
in other in other chains it's uh memecoins memecoins memecoins or some amount of derivatives
trading activity. But uh building a platform is great and

you can kind of say I have a platform and then you can put up
a sign and say open for open grand opening and you can have this view
of like I will build it and they will come and really what what people
come to a platform for is is the value it provides for use cases. And
so And so And so that's the hardest thing. Like you can build a platform
that does a ton of stuff and and that stuff could be technically cool, technically
cool, technically cool, but it it might just not provide

value to anybody. to anybody. And so if there is no killer use case for
your platform in the beginning, your your platform is just is just going to remain
a set of interesting ideas. Uh so that's what you need. You you need that
initial killer use case. Uh and Chainlink got that through DeFi, which is which is
actually why we're so we're so immensely grateful and supportive of DeFi. Like we actually
do a lot of work uh to help DeFi in many ways. We're doing a
lot of work in DC. Uh we have you know

all kinds of conversations about DeFi with a lot of really important folks because we
want to make sure that it it fits into the new regulatory regime in a
way that it can interact with banks institutions and that it doesn't have uh a
ton of you know regulatory and other problems. problems. So it's it's not even I
think fully seen or known everything we do we do for the DeFi community. But
even though I've been spending a lot of time talking about institutions and and all
that liquidity, that's also it doesn't seem that way, but

that's also something that we're doing to benefit DeFi. Because that liquidity will flow into
DeFi, right. So I would say that chain link will be kind of inexurably linked
with with DeFi as a as a trend and as an industry and it will
support that industry. It will help make sure that you know certain things about it
work well from a technical point of view. It'll it'll it'll as a community act
to make sure that you know if the DeFi industry needs an identity solution to
work with banks, it'll have it. If it needs a

good crosschain solution to reliably move across chains, it'll have it. This is, I think,
still at the core of of the ethos and the the thing that chain link
is excited about. Even if even if the the DeFi industry grew to 200 250
billion, then grow beyond, we we are still all in the chain community, I think,
very hyper excited about DeFi and making sure that it's protected from bad regulations, making
sure it has reliable systems. systems. So, it it it could seem that we're like
really thinking about Tradfi and I am. I'm thinking about

trad majority of my mental energy and time, but that's because that is going to
be very good for DeFi. So, I'm I'm very grateful to the chain link community
and to the DeFi community for, you know, working with chain link, giving feedback, and
and in many ways, the DeFi community became part of the chain link community. And
so kind of we we I would say the DeFi community and the chaining community
built this infrastructure together. So that that killer that killer use case everyone will remember
that killer use case if they make a platform like

I think for Twilio it was Uber and you for for other ones it's it's
it's others but that's that's what you have to have if if you don't have
that killer use case that's going to use something from your platform like massively up
and to the right you got to find that thing I read somewhere that you
said I think the pineo or pineapple I don't know who said that in English.
The absolute pinnacle of success for somebody building this type of infra in infrastructure is
that they build something that becomes a public good that

is important to how society functions properly. How can crypto networks become a public good
if Ethereum has Vitalik, Solana has an Anatoli, Poladot has Gavin and Chain Link has
Sergey. I mean because those those things don't don't don't depend on us. Th those
things can operate with without those people. They they they can operate and be successful
and have high quality technical guarantees and mathematical guarantees whether or not those people are
involved. That's that's the that's the answer. the answer. Like I'm not I'm not sitting
around at this point reviewing all the research and and

making sure like everything is perfect with with every aspect of the product. chain link
frankly does too many things for me to just even be able to do that.
So the the the answer is you you make something so valuable that there's enough
people that want to maintain it and want to reliably make it work work work
and it becomes so valuable that society decides that it's a critical kind of utility
that has to exist and I I do think blockchains and oracle networks are are
are like that. I I think we'll we'll reach a

point where so much of society's values, so much of society's transactions, so much of
society's uh relationships are controlled through smart contracts and blockchains and blockchains and blockchains that
it'll be uh a utility. And it'll it'll it'll have to have regulate regulated conditions
for how it works because you you don't have anything that affects society that much
that doesn't have certain legal conditions and regulated conditions. The important thing is that those
regulations are permissive enough to allow innovation and allow permissionless innovation and allow DeFi and
allow all those things to happen while while making sure

that they are not are not are not so non-existent that the whole industry becomes
way too risky for anyone to put their money into. So you kind of have
to have this balance where people feel comfortable that a terra or an FTX won't
happen, but at the same time there's um not too much regulation. We we we
want our industry to be the way society works. That's what that's what if if
we all had the same information, if we had all the information I have, my
view is that everyone in our industry would would want

all of this technology to become like a utility that society doesn't function without. And
it's regulated very lightly, but just enough so that everyone is comfortable with it being
the way society operates. society operates. And that's what mainstream adoption is, right. Because people
will say, "I want mainstream adoption. " Like, "Okay, great. What are the preconditions for
mainstream adoption. " mainstream adoption. " This is this is a real precondition. There's other
preconditions like security, reliability, a better user experience, experience, experience, uh you know, ways to
have direct control over things that aren't such a crazy

user experience. user experience. Uh but this is definitely one of the key preconditions. preconditions.
I mentioned Ethereum has Vitalik, Solana has Anatoli, Pocadotas, Gavin, Chain has Sergey and I
left out Bitcoin who has Satoshi. Some people believe you are Satoshi Nakamoto. Why. I
don't know why. I I I I I I think it's because I was really
early in this industry industry industry and I had I was I was messaging about
stuff and I was just like super early and so people just tried to make
some conspiracy theory. conspiracy theory. I think that's I think

that's all it is. Personally, I think that that that isn't even a single person.
I think it's a group of people and I think some of those people aren't
alive anymore. So, I think it's a group of people. Some of them aren't alive.
um the ones that are alive, you know, they don't want to be associated with
this. Uh I don't think anyone has access to those keys if I had to
guess. So, I don't I I think there's a bunch of these different theories, but
I was talking with I was talking with the founder

of I was talking with the founder of Jupiter Meow Jupiter Meow Jupiter Meow uh
two weeks ago and we're talking about a lot of things and one of them
was we were talking about Satoshi and he was saying how can your ego be
so low or so controlled so controlled so controlled that if you created something like
Bitcoin, you never come out. Why would you Why would you want that. Why would
you want people to to to to bother you about it. I I Whoever whoever
you're talking to, I I I I think they think

that like having a bunch of people want to talk to you is a good
thing. thing. Having a bunch of people want to talk to you is not a
good thing. I have a bunch of people that want to talk to me and
I really appreciate that they want to talk to me and it's really nice that
they're interested in what I'm doing and I wish I had the time to talk
to all of them but I don't and so I have to like prioritize the
stuff I'm able to do versus talking to all these

people. But even for me in my relatively like small corner of the world in
my relatively small part of of of this whole thing which is our industry it's
overwhelming. it's overwhelming. when people want to talk to you this much. So I I
think any person if they were to really think about it, do I want a
bunch of people wanting to talk to me because they think I'm this person. The
answer is no. I don't want these people to talk to me. I appreciate you
taking some time to talk to me. My pleasure. Thomas

Edison, this is on your LinkedIn. Thomas Edison said, "Genius is 1% inspiration and 99%
perspiration. " Yep. No. I mean, I don't know. I don't know about that. I'm
not I'm not sure. It depends how you define that. Probably under most definitions, probably
not. Why do you have this quote on your LinkedIn. So ideas are important but
people overrate their ideas and the impact that having an idea will have on success
and what that code basically means is that execution is most is the most important
thing and that's true but but I don't want to

I don't want to discount the idea. So the idea is important. You have to
have the right idea. You have to have the right priorities. You have to have
the right direction. You have to have that. But it isn't like a binary thing
where you have the idea and you're then you're done or you work on a
bad idea and it's going to work out great. You need both. But but really
what happens is that a lot of the times the idea is is going to
morph. So I think the quote is inspiration. So I

I think for for me when I look at that quote it's like okay you
you had a good idea idea idea now you're going to have to refine that
idea and you do that through in this quote per perspiration but in in in
other quotes or other ideas execution right so you you had a good initial idea
like the the initial idea I would have is this Bitcoin thing seems really cool
if I could just apply what Bitcoin does to a lot other situations that would
be really cool. That's a good idea. But, you know,

that needs a lot of refinement and I've been refining that for, you know, approaching
approaching 15 years now. It's probably still still some more refining to be done. So,
that's what that means. Yeah, it makes me think about all these people who I
would say before starting their first company or before I would say they will never
start a company but they say oh I have this idea but I don't want
to share it with you and that's the one thing that they don't understand actually
I mean you you are actually nice by saying the

idea is very important but obviously the rest is much more I would even say
like the idea yeah it needs to be a decent idea but it's almost worth
nothing if without the execution right and that's what all these people don't understand when
they come and they say I have an amazing idea and they're like, "Okay, what
what what do you want to do. " I can't talk about it now. I'm
going to wait a bit more. I I think what I think what they what
what almost everyone finds when they go and they start

doing it for the vast majority of these ideas is that it needs a lot
of refinement. Like like they thought um that everyone's going to like purple pasta. Like
purple pasta is so cool. Everyone's going to want to eat purple pasta. And I'm
like, "Okay, that's interesting. You seem excited about pasta. You want to go into that.
Why don't you why don't you go figure that out. Like why don't you go
and and talk to somebody who buys that that that and see what they say.
And maybe you're right, like maybe they do, but there'll

be like 50 more problems to solve, right. So I I think it's it's the
refinement of this of this idea and the effort of doing that and and the
fundamental problem that people have, which I understand and can lead to depression, is depressing.
and I've had these kind of things myself is that you you know you're wrong
or or you're right about some part of it but not another part and you
get discouraged. discouraged. So this is where not caring so much what other people think
and and not getting discouraged is very important because you

can have a great idea and then and then in the process of refining it
if you get discouraged you could have you could have refined it for another couple
of months and it actually could have been great but you got discouraged because somebody
said something said something said something and you know maybe they were right and you
just had to do a tweak but you got discouraged. So that's that's the big
challenge I feel people face is this this discouragement. discouragement. What's an example in your
journey where you got discouraged or so discouraged that that

that you went into depression. Well, I sure want to exactly talk about depression but
um an example of that well basically every time I had to switch what I
was doing. So when you when you had to do that hard hard a hard
hard pivot to something but it's in the same industry it's just like okay I'm
not going to do blockchain messaging anymore no crypto mail let's do secure asset exchange
okay secure asset exchange didn't work out let's do smartcontract. com smartcontract. com okay smartcontract.
com didn't work out let's go to the next thing

right every time you have to do that you have to kind of admit a
level of failure and then you have to stop and ask yourself like what did
I learn from this. Then you have to stop and ask yourself, you know, what
am I going to do next. do next. And and that's a that's a painful
process. process. If if if people were to were to think about with me about
like what the key factor in that process is, I think the key factor is
not caring what other people think. people think. So the

thing that I've noticed is the people who are very [Music] [Music] [Music] sensitive to
what other people think are the ones who quit the most because when they fail
the cost of failure for them is very high because now they're they're thinking like
oh my god I have to go back and tell my family I failed and
oh my god I have to tell my friends that I failed and oh my
god I have to tell whoever that I failed. Oh my god, I have to
tell this. And every time they think about that, it's

like this horrible thing. Someone's going to know that I failed. And and what I
basically learned is I don't give a Someone is going to know that I failed,
but someone who probably doesn't even care that I failed is going to know that
I failed. I failed. I mean, they might care and they might tell you they
care and they might even insult you and they might do a whole bunch of
stuff. That might all happen. The thing is that you don't care. Like after enough
of these depressing things, this is what I noticed. I

noticed that like the less like I eventually just wouldn't even tell people what I'm
what I'm working on. on. They'd be like, "What are you doing. " I'm like,
"Look, it doesn't matter what I'm doing. Let's talk about some more interesting. Let's let's
talk about you. " You know, what are you into be. Because I I didn't
I didn't even want to like like like have these conversations. And and and once
you and and even the people that knew what I was doing, if if they
were like, "Oh, I don't think that'll work. " like,

"Okay, thank you so much. I'm going to go back to doing what I'm doing.
" Right. Kind of worrying what people think when they don't have a very informed
point of view is really the thing that messes with you the most. the most.
And and and then the nuance there is you have to make sure that you
don't ignore the people that do know what they're talking about. So if somebody's like
a worldrenowned computer scientist, they come up to me and start talking to me about
something, about something, about something, I shut up and I

start listening. because they're worldrenowned computer scientists and I'm I'm gonna I'm going to learn
something really valuable from this person like almost almost without fail. Um fail. Um but
you you just have to be very careful about that. That's the thing I by
the way I see getting the most people is they is they is they go
out there and they tell everybody what they're doing and then and then when it
fails [Music] [Music] [Music] the failure is like this monumental thing thing thing and then
they got to they they got to explain it to

others. I just wouldn't even explain it. I'd just be like what are you what
are you doing. I'm doing crypto stuff. Or actually what I would do I would
tell them a crazy story so they would leave me alone. I would be like
when when I started doing stuff, they'd be like, "What are you what are you
working on. " And I would tell them, "Do you know what Bitcoin is. "
And they're like, and then many people would say, "It's that drug thing. " And
I'd be like, "Yeah, that that's it. That's right. That's

the thing. " Like like when they would say, because they would just at that
point, I'm a drug dealer. Done. No, I wouldn't say I'm a drug dealer. They'd
be like, "No, it's not. That's the thing related to the the drugs. " And
I would look at them and be like, "Is there any point of me like
am I going to like what's the point of me explaining this to you. cuz
other people would do that. They would like go into it. I'd be like, "Yeah,
that's it. " And you lose so much time and

energy just trying to explain things and or argue with other people. For sure. I
I just I just don't I just don't argue with them and I just avoid
all this negativity unless unless I'm I'm looking at them and I'm like, "Okay, you
you you know something like I should I should talk to you. " M you.
" M but there's there's just so much ne negativity and confusion and all this
and and managing that and avoiding that is important and and and a lot of
people they have this they they have the thing where

they're like well let me hear everyone's perspective. perspective. If you hear everybody's perspective your
head's going to explode. You you you want to hear you want to hear the
perspective of the hyper educated, hyper predictive, hyper, you know, informed informed informed people. And
and that's what you want. You you don't want to like hear 50,000 negative views
that have nothing to do with what's going to actually happen. You're going to you're
going to blow through a ton of time and get depressed. Like, what's the point.
Are you happy. So I'm not really optimizing for happiness.

happiness. I've heard that answer before actually kind of put it that way. Yeah, I've
heard people saying that. So optimizing for happiness is a little bit of a difficult
thing. And Nietze, you know, really helped me out with this uh big time and
I recommend people read Nietze, but with like a reader, like something that can help
explain uh AI can probably help explain. So So the problem with with seeking happiness,
it's a little bit of an elusive thing. And what what people do when they
start hyperfocusing on on am I happy or not is

is they get into this like anxietyinducing circular logic of like I'm not happy because
I'm not happy. Something's very wrong here. I'm unhappy. Oh my god, I'm unhappy. I'm
not happy. Holy I'm not happy. Oh my god. You know, and they and and
just massive anxiety, right. And then they start taking depression medication because something someone somewhere
told them that a being happy is like the point of life and b that
they're entitled to happiness which is the most fascinating idea on earth for me. It's
just like a happiness is the goal of your life.

B, someone somewhere, the government or your parents or someone is supposed to be providing
you this massive happiness. And like if both of if those two things aren't happening,
something's wrong. something's wrong. That by the way, none of that is true. Like the
point of life in my opinion is not to go be really happy. And by
the way, even if it was, nobody owes you any happiness. Nobody's going to give
you any happiness. Like your parents don't owe you you being happy. Your teachers don't
owe you. Your boss doesn't owe you you being happy.

Society doesn't owe you happiness. Like this idea that people are entitled to happiness is
this unbelievable confusion between the concept that they have rights. So they've confused the concept
of like economic rights and the right to speak freely freely freely with the idea
that some somehow they have uh happiness right and that something owes them this. So
this is just fantastically fantastically damaging to to so many people. This is what I
think leads to this like crazy amount of depressive state and and over medication which
then leads to huge hor you know hormonal imbalances which

then good luck correcting those. But basically But basically But basically the the thing I'm
I'm in it for is growth, growth, growth, personal growth. personal growth. That's that's what
I think people should be should should be looking for. And it's a funny thing
where once you once you once you go after personal growth, your view on a
lot of things change. So like is is going through certain amounts of suffering for
the sake of personal growth worth it. Yeah, you know it is worth it. Wow,
look at this. I'm unhappy, but I'm experiencing large amounts

of growth. growth. Okay, that's a good deal. I'm happy. I'm fine with that deal.
That's a good deal. I'm comfortable with it. And so now you don't have this
problem of like constantly recursively looping on like am I happy today. Did did the
people in my life make me happy. Did did the society deliver me the happiness
that I that I somehow fantastically think I owed. Did my did my friends and
family provide me the happiness. Or did they make me unhappy. Oh no, they made
me unhappy. Maybe I should jettison them. Holy Let's maybe

think about how to how to jettison all the things that make you unhappy. You
know, fantastic idea there. Let's jettison all the things that make you unhappy. Actually, the
things that make you unhappy provide the friction that's going to polish you into a
worthwhile person. Like the question is, is the suffering that you're going to go through
worth it. it. Like there's there's there's the type of suffering where it's just painful
suffering. It's not leading to growth. M it's just like you're dealing with someone. Just
painful. Like you're not learning anything. You're not gaining anything.

This is never going to go anywhere. Just pain. This suffering, not so much. That
you can keep. Good luck. See you soon. And you know, you walk the other
way. the the the thing where you're working with someone and you're having a dialogue
and you're disagreeing and you're like thinking through a problem or like a user or
or some institution says to you, "I don't need this shit. " this shit. "
And now you got to spend five years running around with these people through like
two or three cycles of employees that get fired and

hired to finally get them to the point where like it makes sense. That's worth
it. A because you get the outcome. B because you know how to do that.
And so what what you get is you get an an an ability to deal
with the world and its suffering in an effective way. You're not constantly recursively obsessed
and inducing your own anxiety about like do I feel happy who made me unhappy.
Um, and by the way, while you're doing all this, you're you're improving, right. And
and and then you learn the skill of also how

to improve. And and this is really, I think, the pattern of of of most
successful people that I know is that the people that when they got hit with
like a problem, it was like, oh man, this is so uncomfortable. Like, I got
to deal with this Like, oh, I got to deal with these people. I got
to deal with this problem. Oh my god, I got to deal with this. uh
you know uh this isn't really compatible with my happiness now. I'm not going to
do it. And what they gave up on was a

better version of themselves. That's what they lost. What they lost is being a person
that knows how to deal with that That's what they lost. They lost whatever they
were going to get from dealing with it. But really, the most important thing they
lost is being someone who knows how to deal with it. And they're not getting
that. And so the next time they're going to be in that situation, they're going
to fail again. It's going to suck for them massively. And then that situation, chances
are it's going to happen again. And they're going to

fail again. They're going to have that pain. So really, the best thing is when
you encounter this situation, just go through it. Learn how to go through it. The
next time you encounter it, you go through it again. You don't have the pain
and you know how to do it. That's the thing people should do. That's the
good thing. And then you'll have all this great um overcoming and growth. You know,
read Nichza and he'll explain it to you and it'll it'll be very nice. I'm
a big fan of that. I feel good about that.

Thank you so much, Sergey, for being so real and so passionate. That was an
amazing conversation. [Music].
