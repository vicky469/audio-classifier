One of the biggest traumas of my life growing up was that nothing worked. You
would go to the bank, the systems wouldn't work. And my idea was, hey, why
don't we invent an internet currency. >> You built an internet currency called karma. karma.
>> It's cheap to acquire initially and it has proof of work minting in it.
So, one of the key components in Bitcoin was also in karma about 6 years
before Bitcoin came along. >> What did Satoshi Nakamoto do better than you when he
invented Bitcoin. >> We did two major things much better

than I did. Number one technically, >> Emir, the founder of Ava Labs, >> the
team behind Avalanche, a fast scalable blockchain. scalable blockchain. >> A former Cornell professor, he's
driving decentralized finance forward. >> What needs to happen for crypto to go fully mainstream.
fully mainstream. >> I think we have the right architecture for being able to absorb
the growth. And what we don't have is the front end. Wallets are very difficult
to use. We built this wallet called core that is designed to address this difficulty.
>> What does broader crypto use look like. >> Everything

of values on the blockchain and services operate with a chain. >> Can you give
me some examples. We open up the top game on PlayStation and all of the
assets on that game are on a chain. You want to borrow some money from
the bank, you don't go to a bank. You just do it on chain. >>
What's the most important thing to you in life. It >> is being able to
change the world. It's showing the world how it can be much much better. And
I want to prove to all of the crypto naysayers

that crypto is the solution to a lot of the problems that they perceive with
big tech. >> You call Avalanche the home of layer ones. ones. >> Yes, it
is. What did you do differently when you launched Avalanche that helped you become one
of the biggest projects by market cap worth more than $60 billion in 2021. >>
Yeah. So, what did we do right. >> Hi everyone. This is the little bit
that I know none of you like that can help us make a huge difference
for this show and we want to take it next.

third trip to Miami this in the last couple couple months. >> I can see
the the red. Yeah. My nose came off. I know. I got too much sun.
sun. >> What a what what a tough problem to to have. have. It's a
It's okay. Of all the problems to deal with, this is the least of our
worries is World War II that almost broke out. So, you know, compared to that,
this is >> Yeah. What's one of the bad problem

that you have to deal with recently. um trying to figure out where the space
is going, you know, it's like our constant biggest problem and uh and uh how
to get the next billion people into crypto. That's our big problem as a space
as anyone active in the space. >> Amen. >> Yes. >> What is your mission.
>> What's the mission. To take crypto to everybody. So to make it the uh
the primary rail by which every value transfer happens by which every asset is stored,
sent kept, sold and uh the primary means by which

we build services that are not controlled by any single entity. Um so it is
in many ways a uh a king breaker, a technology that uh that makes sure
that tech titans don't get too strong that we democratize the systems that we use.
Why is that so important. >> Because without it we get concentration of power in
just a few hands and that holds a lot of uh a lot of danger
for everyone. everyone. >> Who are you. >> Who am I. It's a good question.
Um so uh I was a I think my uh

I think of myself as a graduate student at all times but uh really I
think the thing that defines me is that I was a professor at Cornell University
for about 19 years. I uh was a professor of computer science. I'm a lifelong
student of computer science. I'm a I'm a geek who loves to build stuff. I'm
a geek who loves to build largecale distributed systems that organize themselves. Uh systems that
provide a service without anyone in charge. Systems that um operate without a centralized owner.
So this is very different obviously from the systems that

most people build, right. They they usually build client server systems. When you go to
use Facebook, you're using Zuckerberg servers. when you go to use Google, you're using Google
servers. And so I like to build systems where you're using anyone's service servers uh
to get a service and there is no single entity in charge. Instead uh uh
the service is provided by some kind of a computer program whose behavior we all
understand and agree to. >> You say I'm someone who loves to build stuff. stuff.
That's not really the image that people have from someone

who is a professor at university which is a very theoretical thing. Uh that's uh
that's true. Most people think of professors as sort of like you know uh disconnected
from reality. People who are sort of far away far apart from uh the day-to-day
concerns. People who think about theoretical foundations and not so much the practical implementations. Um
but that image is is uh is not accurate. Uh so it's true that a
lot of academia is theoretical but there are also um wholesale departments wholesale areas where
people uh do focus on how to build actual things

that work. So uh uh so for example Cornell computer science has a lot of
theoreticians but I was on the practical side of things. I always thought of theoreticians
as people with you know sort of pointy pointy wizard hats or mathematicians hats and
I always wore a hard hat. I always build stuff. Every single uh one of
my papers pretty much uh has a hardcore implementation in it. I really build the
systems. I would like to fully build the systems to understand the nuances. So I
always built stuff. built stuff. >> What made you not

go into business and go into a PhD program. >> Oh um that was easy.
So uh I was graduating from Princeton University. I got into Princeton with a with
a very nice scholarship. I grew up in Turkey. I got a scholarship to Princeton.
and I did my undergraduate studies there. Loved computer science, loved to build u complex
systems, large programs and so on. And I want to learn more and uh and
I want to so I thought well okay now that I finished my undergrad I
should go get a master's degree but master's degrees are

expensive. So I was like well why don't I enroll in a PhD program because
if you're a PhD student they pay you to study >> and you can leave
after a year or two with your masters which is which was my original plan
and then I got into the PhD program. And then I got sucked into how
fun that life is of of figuring out uh answers to questions that nobody knew
the answers to. So that that's what research is all about. And uh and I
love that life and that's sort of what got me

into into the PhD studies. Uh I didn't leave with a masters. I got my
PhD. Then I went on to um to uh to become an academic because I
really like that life of problem solving. >> You said you're from from Turkey. >>
You grew up there. I did in a stumble. >> Beautiful city. The city of
the cats. >> City of cats. That's right. It's a was a gorgeous, especially when
I was growing up with fewer people in it. It was awesome. >> There's a
common pattern across most of the very successful people I

interview on this podcast. They have a childhood trauma or something that happened in their
life that gave them a chip on the shoulder. What happened in your life. That
might explain your hunger for success and your fire in the belly. >> There's a
lot. we're going into therapy now. Um, so there are a lot of things that
happened to any given one of us. But, uh, I think one of the biggest
biggest traumas of my life growing up in Turkey back then was, uh, the fact
that nothing worked. Like you would go to the bank,

the systems wouldn't work. They'd turn you around. You'd have to come back the next
day. You'd go to the airport, >> half the displays would would just blue screen
on you, right. And then uh then they'd be they'd be giving out paper tickets
or whatnot. things that should take no time at all. I knew should take no
time at all were just very difficult. They just wore you down. And at a
very physical level, too, you know, we lived in these houses that weren't perfect by
any means. The windows would close, there'd still be a

draft in the house, right. And uh and so I remember being very very upset
at things that did not work 100%. 99. 9 is good enough maybe for some
people but it just you know it would just piss me off that that if
it didn't work that 0. 1% and in fact back then you know most things
were built to what 85% 95% standard is so quite a lot of the time
things didn't work so um so that's what got me interested in uh in uh
in things that really work that things that reliably provide

a service no matter the circumstances and I remember so when I was growing up
uh you had to take this big exam to get into schools and if you're
in the top, you know, whatever 110 people or so, you go to you go
to this one American school for for middle school and high school. I got into
the school and uh I remember my first day uh walking up to these big
doors um built by to American standards and I walked through the door and it
closed behind me with a satisfying click. I was like,

"Yes, I am. I am where I belong. These people know how to build things
that actually work. " and that that got me on the path to engineering large
things that work. >> Quick shout out to our sponsors who make this show possible.

that that live through the dark old ages of computerization. >> You'd go there, they'd
rely on a centralized server. Server's down. What do you do. Nothing. You just go
back come back tomorrow. >> I mean, I just I was in Bali a couple
of weeks ago. I live in Singapore, so it's not far. not far. >> Uh
and it's a beautiful island. It's amazing. But nothing works. And so I would just
go, you know, we're going to to the south of the island. We we just
say, "Oh, let's go buy a bottle of water. "

water. " >> Mhm. in the supermarket. >> It took us 45 minutes for a
bottle of water because we go there, the system doesn't work. Then we don't have
cash because we don't use cash anymore. Then uh then the cash machine kind of
works, but it doesn't work again. Then there's a huge queue. Then okay, let's go
and get some cash out. Then 45 minutes for a bottle of water. >> Absolutely.
>> And then you're like, if a bottle of water takes 45 minutes, how do
you build a business here. It's impossible. >> You can't.

Okay. And the contrast from Singapore to Bali must be >> I would say the
contrast from Singapore to a lot of places. >> Yeah, that's a that's that's Singapore
is an island where everything works. That's Yeah, it's quite a quite a culture shock.
culture shock. >> You built an internet currency called karma in 2022. >> I did
uh no in 2002. So 22. So 23 years ago today. >> What is an
internet currency. >> Ah why do we need one. Because back then uh people were
really into file sharing and um you know so file

sharing was really big. Everybody was downloading music and other stuff and um and so
and there was a craze like because you could do with a file sharing service
what what big business couldn't do. You couldn't download music at the time. You had
to buy a shrink wrapped CD or DVD or whatnot. So there was something available
on the internet. It worked through these self-organizing file sharing networks. But there was a
problem with all of these systems, as is often a problem when you have communities
trying to get stuff done, which is people wanted to

take things. Nobody wanted to donate things to the common good. So everybody wanted to
download, nobody wanted to upload. Uploading got you, you know, got your bandwidth occupied at
at a minimum. So um so there had to be some system, something to incentivize
people to occasionally do good for the world, right. And so I figured, okay, uh
what can we do. Um, one of the things that people came up with at
the time was Bit Torrent, which is still around, and that's a barterbased system. And,
um, uh, my idea was, hey, why don't we invent

some kind of an internet currency, and it's cheap to acquire initially, uh, but but
you can't acquire, you know, there's a finite amount of it. And, um, and so,
so you acquire it, and then every time you download a file, you use some
of it. And at some point, you're going to run out. and uh and if
you don't want to run out, you have to be good and you have to
actually provide services to others as well. So that was the genesis of the karma
currency in 2002. It was peer-reviewed and published in 2003

and um it has proof of work minting in it. So one of the key
components that uh is in Bitcoin was also in karma about 6 years before Bitcoin
came along. What did Satoshi Nakamoto do better than you. Um, in late 2008 when
he invented Bitcoin, Bitcoin, Bitcoin, >> he did something he did a couple of things,
right. So, he did two two major things much better than I did. Number one,
technically he ended up taking the consensus side of the of the of the equation,
the consensus problem, and folding it into the coin creation

problem. So in in Bitcoin mining when you're creating the coin when when a minor
is creating coins he's also codifying what happened in the preceding 10 minutes. So that
was something that in karma was disjoint. I had proof of work minting but the
consensus was classical consensus. It's it was still done by quorums of uh of nodes
and uh that wasn't as lightweight that wasn't as um as open as uh as
Bitcoin was later on. So Satoshi had an incredible insight that uh that really changed
I think the world for much better uh technically when

he came up with that part. He also had another big idea that I completely
missed. He was so I was working in the aftermath of 9/11. I was working
in the aftermath of you know people being very concerned about havala networks about you
know money flows terrorist financing and so on. And so I always conceived of what
I was building as something only that only targets the file sharing problem. But uh
Satoshi was was coming right after the 2008 crisis. And uh and he had a
much grander vision. He was like well let's just down

with fiat. Let's come up with a new store of value, a new asset that
is that will replace fiat. And that's um that's a that's that's the kind of
big vision that uh you know as a younger person who was trying to do
something much more contained I did not have. So he he nailed two fronts that
in a way that uh that I did not. >> But you identified some flaws
in what he did too. Right. >> I did. I found an me and my
co co-author. We found the biggest known flaw in Bitcoin

and we found some flaws in what Satoshi claimed about his own his own system.
what what were those flows. flows. >> So, uh we invented something called selfish mining
and uh essentially what we what we showed the world was uh some of the
claims that Satoshi made about Bitcoin are incorrect. So, what are those claims. For a
system like Bitcoin to uh to to work, for a system like Bitcoin to be
compelling, it has to have a key property called incentive compatibility. What does that mean.
It means that the participants should follow should have incentives

to follow the protocol the protocol the protocol >> as opposed to incentives to diverge
from the protocol and do something else. If I can make more money doing something
else, well then the pro protocol is not compelling as it is. It's not the
thing that people should do will do uh when when when they have you know
when their incentives are are sort of pulling them away from what you told them
to do. So everybody thought uh that uh that that Bitcoin was incentive compatible. Everybody
thought that as long as an adversary was less than

uh 51% that he would not be able to benefit um from diverging from the
protocol and Satoshi explicitly claimed this uh people repeated this. There was even a study
an academic study by some academics that turned out to be deeply flawed u that
claimed this and um and so the work that we did with selfish mining was
look uh there's another way to approach the Bitcoin mining protocol. you don't have to
follow what what Satoshi told you to do and in fact if you don't do
it and follow this other product other uh other strategy

you can make more money so your incentives can lie elsewhere and you can make
more money doing selfish mining as opposed to regular mining. So uh this of course
was anathema to Bitcoin maxis at the time because it implies that Satoshi made a
mistake and Satoshi of course you know the Bitcoin maxis believe is this infallible person.
Everything he said is is is wonderful and and he has made no mistakes. So
um uh so we when we came up with with selfish mining it ruffled a
lot of feathers. I mean it it's all sorts of

things started going south. Uh it started getting death threats. Um, there was a there
was a letterw writing campaign for Cornell to fire me. I was a tenure professor
at the time, so they couldn't fire me. And I was it was nice watching
all the letters going around. It was kind of unnerving at the time, but you
know, it's okay. It's was like they can't fire me. It's okay. And um and
there was even uh crowdfunded studies, crowdfunded projects to prove us wrong. And all three
of those projects flipped. All the leads flipped and said

after a while uh they said, "Look, you know what these guys claim is exactly
right. all the simulations actually confirm what they said and selfish mining is a thing
and uh and by that time people had realized hey we weren't trying to tear
down Bitcoin we were trying to better characterize its security and um and if you
do characterize it better then you can guard against selfish mining attacks if you know
what can happen what can go south you can watch for it and make sure
that it doesn't happen in practice so uh then ultimately

what's happened is people adopted us and decided hey these people are actually in crypto
to make crypto much better they're scient test they provide the foundations that we need
and uh they started inviting me to all the crypto conferences and so on. So
that's how I got into the space. >> When was this story. >> 2013 >>
2013 >> 2013 12 13 around then. >> What is maximalism a good thing. >>
Absolutely horrible thing. >> Why. >> Because um maximalism is religion. Maximalism is a cult
for any maximalism even the avalanche maxis. So um there

is nothing that's unassailable in the world. The only god that you should have is
probably science and um and so uh so the right thing to do is always
to approach all claims with skepticism to to demand proof to demand scientific proof to
validate things etc. And if there are better ideas if there is something that shows
hey these these beliefs are false then you should abandon them and adopt better beliefs.
>> Can you take the side of maximalism. Tell me something positive about maximalism. maximalism.
>> Sure. Maximalism allows communities to bind together very strongly

and it creates very strong communities. So uh so that's why you see cults as
long-standing things. There there are thousand year old cults around in the world, right. People
still dress like they did hundreds of years ago, do things in the old ways,
etc. So um it it it allows groups of people to capture some set of
values uh and some sets of behaviors that sometimes might be okay to preserve. to
preserve. So uh so maximalism has that positive side but it also has the problem
that if you adopt the wrong ideas that discredited ideas

or uh technical beliefs that are incorrect then you might find yourself you know still
trying to use a gas engine to you know to do your farming with when
there are better better uh you know or kerosene engines or whatever it is that
the Amish use right so so they they're allowed to use certain things but not
electricity right it's just it's kind of an odd odd behavior they their their behavior
is frozen in the 1800s. That's a strange thing to be doing. >> I mean,
we've seen that at various degrees, right, with Ethereum lately.

>> We've seen that with Luna, like a more extreme example of what maximalism can
do to people. >> Uh in terms of negative consequences, basically going broke. Um, do
you think that Bitcoin and crypto would be where we are today without a good
dose of maxi maximism in the early days. days. >> I think we'd be far
farther. We we would not have the uh the backlash against crypto that we ended
up having. I think Maxis did great disservice to the crypto crypto movement. Um, do
I think that uh um that the uh the the

uh store of value narrative of of Bitcoin would be as strong. Probably wouldn't be
as strong. I think the Maxis really repeated that mantra really well and they really
sold Bitcoin to the masses as a store of value. And um so uh so
yeah, Bitcoin probably wouldn't be where it is today, but crypto would be further along.
There'd be less backlash against crypto. How did you get so fascinated by the world
of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies. cryptocurrencies. >> I think it all started with the karma
work. You know, I like self-organizing systems. That's clear. And

then uh and then once I saw Bitcoin, I was like, okay, this is there's
something much much bigger here. There is a bigger movement. And I think the fundamental
thing that attracted me is the fact that crypto is the next sort of destination
in the evolution of large-scale computer systems. You know, when I was growing up, we
barely knew how to build a computer that's that stood alone, right. That operated by
itself. >> And uh as I got older, you know, I started seeing mainframes, etc.
So, you know, people started learning how to build bigger

and bigger systems. Uh we started getting network systems. We started having PCs at home
and you could connect to each, you know, connect these PCs to each other, but
you could generally you would connect them to servers. we barely uh had solved how
to build client server systems and that begat us the the dotcom boom >> and
um and I think the next stage in the evolution of computer systems are largecale
systems where no one's in charge where the system provides a service without necessarily a
titan a tech titan providing that service and that democratization

is in line with my values is in line with the world that I want
to build I want people to be able to count on a service without having
to trust the service provider provider because the service providers have time and time again
proven that they are not trustworthy. trustworthy. >> How far are we from that word.
>> It takes a lot of time. >> I think the core tech is there.
It takes a lot of time. Uh it takes uh it takes a lot of
u sort of slow evolution. It takes a a conducive

regulatory en environment. So um imagine imagine that we had the dot boom or the.
com ideas. We had the internet's foundations but the rules were that um the only
thing you could hold you could put on the internet would be things that don't
have any impact on anything. Cat pictures. The internet would then be just a place
for cat pictures and cat pictures alone. And um and uh and so and if
you had to vet every user, you have to know the identity of every internet
user before you serve a cat picture to anyone, you

have to know who they are. So that clearly would be a terrible universe. That
that's literally what we went through with crypto. >> And uh the regulators were not
at all uh um happy about about the disruption that crypto could cause >> and
they did everything to sloww walk our space. So we uh we ended up getting
delayed quite a bit but um but I think the foundations are there and society
at large now understands what crypto can do. They understand how easy it is to
use these services. There is still a hurdle for DeFi.

I think we're still one or two years away from uh generalized generalized DeFi acceptance
and uh we're probably about five years away from uh broader crypto use and probably
10 years away from governmental crypto use. It uh it essentially means or I think
the telltale signs of broader crypto use are that everything of value is on a
blockchain and services operate with a chain. chain. >> In in 5 years, >> yeah,
>> yeah, >> yeah, >> we sit down here >> in the studio with a
few few more gray hair, maybe less hair. >> What

does the world look like. >> That's changing. I think uh the world look like
looks like we fire up PS5. We open up the top game on uh on
PlayStation and uh there's going to be PS15 by then, right. So, uh we open
up a PS15 uh we look at the top game and all of the assets
on that game are on the chain. >> So, that's beginning to happen today with
uh efforts like Off the Grid. That game, if you've played it, is amazing. Um
in it, every arm, every mech arm, every mech leg,

every every piece of armor, every piece of ammo is an asset, is an NFT
asset in game. You can buy and sell it and trade it on the side.
you can play the game and get them by killing people. It's just it's a
fascinating game fascinating game fascinating game >> and that would be the primary means that
would be in the gaming space. You go to borrow some money from the you
want to borrow some money from the bank. You don't go to a bank. There's
no there would be no need and uh you just

do it onchain. onchain. >> Uh and I can just sort of enumerate many other
examples. You go to instead of going to the DMV, you go to the chain
and you do a transfer of your car when you sell your car and it's
it happens within seconds instead of months. So everything that has a value to anyone
that is not necessarily kind of part of the GDP today because it cannot be
valued necessarily valued necessarily valued necessarily >> will be in five years and the example
is some items in a in a game or basically

anything anything anything >> anything anything. So absolutely anything and everything whether it's the the
keys to your car, the the title to your car, the deed to your house,
the um virtual assets that people create, virtual assets that companies create and uh in
every financial transaction. All of these things have to happen on the blockchain. That's the
right way to do it. Everybody who's listening to me who understands the tech knows
that this is the only way we build auditable, coherent systems that reconcile with each
other cheaply, easily, and in the fastest manner possible. Quick

is the latest um system that um embodies the b best um best uh technology
when it comes to blockchains. It facilitates building of uh

chains for a multitude of uses. uh facilitates the cre creation of digital assets that
can be sent anywhere at any time and allows the creation of services where no
one is in charge. in charge. >> You told me you launched Avalanche because crypto
was full of idiots who make all decisions. >> That's not wrong. >> Can you
explain. I mean this space is uh there's so many the space has so many
sins. I think uh your audience knows this very well. Um it's a it's look
the people have been selling the crypto vision for a

long time right and if you look at how many systems have matched up to
what how they got sold is is very few systems right so there's always some
constant sort of dangling uh shiny crypto object you know such and such will happen
and then we're going to be able to scale Ethereum such and such will then
happen and then we're going to scale it and so there's there's always some promises
of technologies that would come maybe someday today. It's kind of like waiting for Godo.
Let's wait for Godo. When he comes, it's going to

be so good. Life's going to be great. All of our problems are going to
be solved. And uh and Godo changes. Like every time something materializes, people realize, hey,
we we pinned our hopes on on a set of technologies that we did not
quite understand whose drawbacks we didn't really follow. And now that the technology is real
and here we realize we were wrong. We were led to a to a blind
alley. And Ethereum was doing this again and again and again. >> And I watched
this happen. I watched a whole bunch of other chains

uh app bring absolutely nothing to the space. Ethereum at least tried to bring some
stuff and uh and as a technologist it really irked me that uh that there
was a there was a a big group of people essentially in the business of
selling hopes and dreams but not really materializing them. So uh I thought hey we
we know how to build stuff. We know the best of technology. We have a
pragmatist uh side to us. So we know which technologies are are essentially [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and
not quite here um and will have huge drawbacks and

which technologies will really move the needle. And so I thought hey let me bring
this new sensibility into crypto. >> Why do you think that there was that these
people were doing these things that way. Is it because I mean straight scams. Is
it because ah now we raised the money but the actual thing is hard to
do is build, right. But we don't need to build because we have the money.
>> Um is it because they tried but it failed. failed. >> It's all of
those. You know, there's there's a multitude of people. Um

some people are in it for just scams. You know, you hear about some chain
that comes out of nowhere, brings nothing to the space. You don't know why it's
it's supposed to be good or a new asset shows up. There's a guy behind
it, especially if the guy is quirky, right. He's acting like he's, you know, it's
it's a dumb person's idea of what a genius looks like, right. So, uh, you
know, curly hair, can't tie his shoes, right. I'm referring to SPF here, of course.
Never understood what he brought to the space. I was

like, it's just some rando dude. A lot of rando dudes in the space. And
uh, and so people go, hey, okay, so that's uh, it's easy to identify scams.
They're also um, hopeful optimists. They're like, "Hey, you know, I don't really know much
about this technology, but it sounds like it could fix some problem I have. "
And then they go following uh that path. I think a lot of people in
Ethereum followed uh verifiable delay functions. VDFs were going to, you know, for a long
time that was going to be the scalability approach for

Ethereum. All of us knew in in academia that that was a dead end. Um
so it was VDFs that didn't pan out for them. VRFs, verifiable random functions were
going to be key to scaling Ethereum. That didn't work out. And then accumulators were
going to help and that didn't work out. Snarks and that didn't work out. And
then ZKevms and that didn't work out. So there was that shiny object phenomena that
was just plaguing that community. And um yeah, it's definitely not scams. Those people really
genuinely thought, hey, these technologies will will fix it. But

it's it got to a caricaturized version of itself towards the end where essentially what
they were doing is looking at the cryptography journals and picking the latest shiniest object
and holding that up instead in in front of their audiences as opposed to actually
getting into the weeds and solving actual scalability problems. So it was behind it was
against that backdrop that uh we did the avalanche work and thought hey we really
need to show the world how this is done. Uh, it sounds like the the
the people who make the most noise don't know how

to get us to the destination. >> So, you launched Avalanche because crypto was full
of idiots who make wrong decisions. Has this changed. >> Um, yeah, I think it
has. I think it has. A lot of things have changed. I think the days
of um of uh constantly selling dreams are over. The days of um uh technical
influencers directing huge money flows are over. The days of selfies are over, right. You
take a selfie with Vitalic and you're like, "Hey, I'm Ethereum aligned, you know. "
No, dude. You just copied some some code, you know.

You're running it on your laptop. There's nothing crypto about what you're doing. It's just
a it's just essentially a scam at that point. So, I think those days are
gone. Uh we just went through the phase of uh proximity to politicians, right. We
went to the selfies with Trump era and I think that's done as well. Um
I think we're getting getting to the the you know show me era where people
will demand to see actual proof of working systems and uh selling dreams is going
to be harder and harder and um so I can't

wait because that's when we shine because we've been building quietly in the background these
large systems with large partners uh that really change the way things work. We really
pride pride ourselves on building things that actually work that are actually usable and um
and I'm really excited about what's to come. >> What did you do differently when
you launched Avalanche that helped you stand out in a sea of layer ones and
helped you become one of the biggest projects by market cap worth more than $60
billion in 2021. So what did we do right. We

did a a lot of things right. I think we brought to the space the
biggest breakthrough in in the most important area that limited scalability and that was consensus
protocols. So for those of you in the audience who are following sort of the
technical uh technical evolution of these systems uh there are only three different approaches to
to consensus. A lot of people will say oh we have a novel consensus mechanism.
No they don't. They're like, you know, it's like there's a hat, you know, a
hat is a way to keep this the the rain

out and they're putting feathers on it. Hey, mine is novel. No, dude. It's just
a basic hat. You put a feather, you put two feathers, you put 15 feather,
whatever the hell you put, you maybe you put, you know, whatever stringers on it,
but it's still a hat at the end of the day. So, umbrellas are a
different technology, right. So, we brought the uh the new technology into the space. There
are only three ways of doing consensus. the Bitcoin way, the classical consensus way, which
is what I was using in karma, which is what

Ethereum and Solana and others are using, and then the avalanche way. So, that was
one of the main technical uh and it's probably the biggest technical breakthrough in the
space of consensus protocols in the last 50 years, the entire time that this this
area has been around. That was one. Uh number two, we did our launch in
a way that is absolutely the most conducive to participation. We always uh worked to
make sure that crowds could participate in our success. >> We offered uh the same
terms to everybody. We allowed everyone to get in on

the ground floor and um and uh and build large systems with us. Uh number
three is relentless dedication by our community to to essentially pushing Avalanche to wherever it
will go. And uh that's how we were able to get you know cutting edge
partnerships. we were able to get uh absolute users who came to us and uh
and said hey we without announcing to anyone we've been using your system because it's
one of the few systems that actually work and handles the load that we have.
So uh so those are things that really helped us

um and uh you know it's hard to pinpoint any one thing but in combination
they brought us to where we are. >> What did you do wrong. >> What
did I do wrong. Of course so many things. Um, I think one of my
greatest problems has always been the uh the the difficulty of of getting the word
out. I think my marketing has always been weak. And um so if you look
at Avalanche and if I had to identify the thing that I I'm the weakest
at, that would be by far uh the area where

I need the most help. So when you have a chain that that's got nothing
to it, right. You it's just there's no new technology. It's just a chain. it's
running on your laptop or it's running on on your laptop and five of your
friends laptops, right. So, uh then you have all the time in the world to
push that thing. You have all the time to think about how you're going to
market that thing and uh and there are many chains like this and um and
the people behind them, you know, they they're fantastic at

marketing. That's that's what they do, right. That's like, you know, all day long, every
day, that's what they think about. And um in contrast, we are constantly pushing the
boundaries of the technology. We're constantly bringing the best of tech, best of science into
Avalanche. Um, I'm running a fairly big show with hundreds of people, hundreds of devs,
uh, developing new technologies, new new things on top of Avalanche. And so, that didn't
leave me as much time to get the word out. And, um, and I think
to this day, um, I would say that that's the

part where I'm weakest. And from my own community, that's one of the things that
I need the most of to help with the with getting the word out. I
had Gavin Wood from Polka Dot on this podcast and he firmly believes that the
best tech must win and will win. What do you think about that. >> Best
tech doesn't always win, doesn't doesn't have to win. Uh but in the long term,
um the chain that will come out ahead will be that which can absorb the
enormous growth we're going to have in the space the

space the space that I firmly believe in. And if we think about sort of
uh the systems out there um you know let me characterize them right. So you
have very early systems generation one chains like bitcoin where you have a single asset
BTC and a single single chain. Then you have generation 2 which is ethereum solana
and others which are uh multiasset but single chain. There's a single chain everybody must
use that one chain and uh but you can have multiple chains multiple assets on
that chain. So that's okay. But those things conk out

when somebody is doing an NFT release, when someone's doing an airdrop, Ethereum becomes unusable.
Solana becomes unusable. Solana stops, you know, used to stop, you know, a couple times
a month. So, um, uh, so then the third generation, the latest generation of systems
out there, and there are only a few of these, uh, are the systems that
are multi-asset, multi-chain. Avalanche is at the forefront of these. Gavin system, polka dot is
another one of them, and Cosmos, Cosmos is another one of them. So the the
three of us are the multi-chain systems and the multi-chain

thesis has been borne out. That is to say our approach to scalability is the
one that can absorb the growth as new applications develop their own chains on top
of us. That adds to our performance. We don't have to compete for performance and
uh and we can absorb the growth that is to come from all sorts of
uh uh industry all sorts of governments building their own systems on the blockchain. blockchain.
Yes, it is. >> What does that mean. Explain simply. No jargon. jargon. >> No
jargon. Um, Avalanche is not a single chain. It allows

other pe it allows anyone to build their own blockchain on top. It's a network
of networks. So, it's very different from Ethereum, very different from Solana, very different from
from Bitcoin and others. It's essentially a network of networks where anyone can start their
own chain according to their own rules, digitize their own assets, use their assets as
gas, use their assets as collateral, use their assets for staking, use it for whatever
they might want to to use their asset for on their own terms. This enables
us, this enables our users rather to build custom application

specific chains. They can build a chain for use by Europeans according to European rules,
GDPR rules, etc. They can create a chain for use by people on Wall Street,
but people who are doing games, who are doing whatever else that they might want
to do. And these things can then communicate with each other in a seamless fashion.
We bring to the space what uh Ethernet brought to computer networking back in the
80s. >> Can you give me an example of what Ethernet brought back into the
80s, but in the inter Ethernet and internet era so

people can >> can understand better. So um the what I what what happened back
then was u uh was essentially a transformation from uh single mainframes from single servers
to multiple servers that interoperate with each other. We it enabled campuses to connect to
each other to send messages uh emails from one campus to another and that gave
us the birth of the internet. The internet got created by people connecting uh campuses
to each other via via these network connections. In a similar fashion, Avalanche allows you
to create a chain, me to create a chain, and

these chains to interoperate by sending messages back and forth. These chains to send assets
from one chain to another whenever that makes sense, and facilitates the interoperable collection of
of these chains that operate together. together. I had conversation with uh Anatoli from Sena,
Gavinwood from Poladot, Steven from Arbitro, Jesse Pak from Baze, bunch of other people. Each
one has a different approach to scaling. scaling. >> How does Avalanche scale. So you
said before the ones that will be at the forefront are the ones that are
going to be able to scale when we hit this

this moment of mass adoption. So the avalanche approach to scaling is to allow multiple
chains to coexist under the same rubric under the same umbrella. same umbrella. >> That's
very different from every single person that you mentioned in that list. So all of
these people are going to try to to jam-pack all users onto a single chain
base, Solana and every everything else that you just mentioned. These are all single chains
at the end of the day and every user in effect competes with every other
user for blockchain space on that chain. The avalanche approach

is different. When you have a use case, then you can start your own chain
that operates according to its own rules on its own terms with its own validators
with its own resources and that chain can interoperate and communicate with other users using
that have built different chains. We don't have to jam-pack them onto the same infrastructure
onto the same set of limited resources. That is the biggest difference between us and
everyone else that you just mentioned. You talked about gaming before when you talked about
uh each uh each uh each uh each asset that

or each uh thing that has value today will be uh on a blockchain, right.
Avalanche is pretty focused on a bunch of things. One of them is gaming. Why
do some people call Avalanche the gaming blockchain. So, some people do call it call
it that. I never do. We work really hard to make sure that uh that
we we we have built a platform that's usable usable for anything and everything under
the sky. There are many many many other use cases besides just gaming. But um
but a lot of games come to us because they

have really stringent requirements. The game play has to be fantastic. The game play has
to be super fast. Uh it has to be seamless and the system overall has
to be reliable. If imagine you turn on your PS, whatever it is, five today,
15 tomorrow, um, and you can't connect or whatever, the the the performance is not
good enough or you kill somebody, but you can't collect their resources because you lack
enough uh coins for for gas. Like that's just not a a usable platform. So,
um, so gaming developers have been coming to us saying,

"We've studied what's happening in the space. Yours and yours alone is the only system
that we trust for our demanding users. " And I'm really proud of our our
uh track record in this case. Off the grid is a huge game that launched
on top of us. I believe they have more than 15 million users. So in
the last bull cycle of crypto, there were these chains that made a crap ton
of noise. And in fact, a bunch of the people that you just mentioned, you
sum up all the users for quite a few of

them. Sum up every single one of their users and they still wouldn't approach this
one game, the number of users this one game brought to Avalanche. So um when
you have such a big load, when you have such high reliability requirements, speed requirements,
then you know where to go and that's avalanche. That's what people have been doing
to us. >> What's the right way to do crypto gaming. gaming. >> So um
and that's this is going to sound super obvious. So but it wasn't obvious a
few years ago. So a few years ago, everybody thought

web 3 gaming was, you know, Axi Infinity Ponzi games. you know, I take your
coin, I sit on it, and I don't know what you pay me or I
pay you, but you know, new users pay old users, something like that. It creates
just very Ponzi Ponzi like behaviors. And people thought it was all about that kind
of terrible financial transactions. Uh we had this the world's simplest thesis, which was build
a game that's compelling to play, build a AAA game that's compelling to play. um
and um and put it on a blockchain infrastructure so

that it has the ability for the gamers to participate in running the game in
enforcing the rules um that allows people to create third-party value added services. And uh
the first example of this was Godzilla's off the grid. I mentioned this already. It's
set on an island. Uh you're what's called a zero, like a mercenary who's got
nothing to lose. you cut your arms off, you cut your legs off, you put
these mechanical arms and legs, and then uh then you jetack onto the island, you
start killing people in that game. Uh but then more

recently, we've had Maple Story come in, and Maple Story is exactly the opposite. It's
a it's many many many millions of users, especially in Southeast Asia, who love the
game. They have uh you know, tens of millions of users and uh and uh
it's a very much different universe, gentler universe. But again, uh all the game interactions
are happening on a blockchain so that they're open, auditable, and so on. In these
games, often the game uh the game designers will say, "Hey, here's a new weapon.
We're going to sell it for this much, and there

will be only so many of them. " them. " >> And to this day,
you couldn't really audit that. Do you really know how many, you know, whatever it
is, World of Warcraft, uh whatever swords of death there were. No one knows these
things. But with Off the Grid, that's easily auditable. with Maple Story, this this new
version of it that's on Avalanche now. Uh everything is auditable and transparent. transparent. >>
What is Maple Story Universe and what's the relationship with Avalanche. >> Um they are
um Maple Story Universe is a is an independent company.

It's a gaming company based in Korea, I believe. Um with a huge installed user
base with a huge set of people who grew up playing these games. Um, it's
really hard to explain this, but uh I think you know your audience will immediately
recognize the artistic style of the Maple Story universe. Uh, it's a lovely game uh
with a with a large number of people who grew up playing it and um
and that game was recently by the creators of the game moved to a blockchain
foundation as an Avalanche L1. So they're building on Avalanche,

they're using Avalanche and they built their own chain on top of us. You see
RWA, real world assets as a foundational layer enabling future DeFi applications. applications. >> Can
you explain what that means. Um, so R, what are RWS. That's an acronym. Real
world assets. Uh, we firmly believe that uh that everything of value should be on
a blockchain. That's the best way to maximize its value. It's its reach should not
be limited by technological means. If I want to sell something, I should be able
to sell it to anybody on earth and transfer ownership

immediately uh to anyone. So, um that's that was the core vision and when we
were starting out, our by line was uh digitize all of the world's assets. So,
Avalanche's mission initially was essentially this. And uh so why is this important. Well, um,
for example, uh, recently Bergen County in New Jersey, um, announced that they would be
putting about 200 billion dollars worth of land records on Avalanche. And, uh, they came
to this conclusion after doing a thorough study of the technological uh, offerings provided by
different chains and thought Avalanche is the uh, the foundation

that we're going to be building on when you have that much. So, let let's
actually roll back a little bit. Those of those of your your of the people
in in your audience who ever did a title transfer will know that when you
do a title transfer, it's actually a complicated process. You typically need title insurance. You
need to make sure that you are not being scammed that the person selling the
title to indeed has it and so forth. So, putting those those uh assets on
chain immediately fixes all of the uncertainty with ownership. Transfers

are very very easy to audit. Uh competing claims are easy to ascertain, etc. And
in addition once those ch those assets are onchain then they become the foundational pieces
of value on which you can do decentralized finance. When you have your deed in
your hand you can simply put that up as collateral and borrow against it and
that need not be a weeksl long process with a bank but instead it's essentially
a fairly it can be an automated process that's done on chain within a few
minutes. minutes. How big is this RWA thing. >> Trillions

and trillions of dollars. So I think there's about 700 trill trillion in assets in
the world >> and uh and real estate alone is about 200 trillion of it.
There are many other assets that are real world besides real estate of course. So
um so many hundreds of trillions uh worth of assets will be digitized in the
next decade. If blockchain fixes this, the there's the meme bitcoin fixes this, blockchain fixes
this, fixes this, fixes this, >> that's right. >> Why is it so slow. >>
The the process of transformation because because of regulatory lack

of clarity. So I think for actually that's not true. Um why is it so
slow. I think for the first decade for decade and a half is spent solely
on education as as was the case with with the internet. The internet started becoming
a real thing in the 80s. like you know people were using email in the
80s. M >> it's only in the mid '90s that people realized hey this thing
can do more than email this thing can do all sorts of other things and
then you know then it started with the dot thing

and then we got differentiation within. com so uh that first decade and a half
just went in just got absorbed you saw no progress right in the 80s people
be like why is the internet not exploding well because nobody not enough people understand
how it works what it could do so there is that the initial part is
just education uh the secondary part is regulatory clarity Okay. And uh the third one
is is essentially differentiation, market forming, double-sided market formation, etc. Many of these processes are
human processes that take time >> and humans are slow.

>> Oh, sure. >> They are the technology goes fast but people Yeah. If you
look at and this is blockchain like which is like very intimidating for a lot
of people but if you just look at data right data is the same problem.
There was all this big data thing whatever 10 years ago then AI everything is
so slow because humans are slow. Yeah, slow. Yeah, >> the technology is going fast
but the people are slow. >> Another big one building the layer one blockchain on
the top of Avalanche is FIFA. FIFA. >> Yeah, they

are. >> Why did FIFA choose Avalanche and why now. now. >> I think that's
a question best uh best directed to them. Um so FIFA was a fantastic partner.
You know that they have uh they have uh uh requirements that are very demanding.
So uh many of the chains that make a lot of noise out there just
lack the uh the underlying capacity to support what FIFA needs. Um one of the
key differentiators for us I'm going to repeat what I said earlier but uh but
this is you know that's the answer to the question.

FIFA needs its own chain that operates according to its own rules and um and
that chain needs to be fast and reliable and Avalanche is the only system that
had those characteristics for them. >> What's the end game for Avalanche. >> The end
game. The endgame is to to dominate the world and provide the rails for everybody
to digitize all of the valuable things that they have. >> You're saying that >>
that's not the end. That's I think the beginning of the a new beginning. You're
saying that the Avalanche approach is multi-chain, right. multi-chain, right.

>> But ultimately, does the endgame for Avalanche mean that everyone is in your ecosystem,
everyone is building on Avalanche or is there a word where we have this kind
of multi-chain approach with other ecosystem, other of these other ecosystems that have a very
different way of thinking than you. >> Yeah, that's an interesting question, right. So if
you like fast forward like couple decades, is it going to be a single system
to rule them all or is it going to be a multitude of systems that
interoperate with each other. So um uh if you look

at what's happened on the internet, right, the technologies disappear, they get commoditized, they get
hidden behind uh behind layers and um uh but usually what happens is one technology
dominates. So I do believe that it's going to be a winner takes all environment.
that winner has has got to be uh technologically foundationally and and uh and fundamentally
able to absorb multiple different use cases. >> And so um so that's I think
the the end world that we're moving to. Um Bitcoin even Bitcoin uh I see
you know couple decades from now uh needing the kinds

of fast transfers at the settlement layer that Avalanche offers. So I can see actual
ways in which Bitcoin would be married so to speak with Avalanche. Bitcoin would always
have its own proofof work mining foundation. >> But uh I can see approaches where
you put Avalanche in front of Bitcoin >> and then the Bitcoin mining comes in
and sort of double stitches, right. It it it uh it adds proof of work
to decisions that have already been made in the in the in a uh in
a by an avalanche L1 that's sitting in front of

Bitcoin. So uh so there are I think the universe is one where we go
to a fast fast fast fast foundation and uh there's going to be a winner
takes all kind of a dynamic there and uh and I'm really excited about how
flexible Avalanche is in that it can absorb these other chains and allow them to
to keep on doing their core operation on top of Avalanche and and and tie
into Avalanch's interoperability its low latency and it's high capacity. I recorded recently with Lily
from Solana Foundation. Foundation. >> She says Bitcoin is the

asset. Sena is the infrastructure. the infrastructure. I don't know what those means. >> So
for you it's not Bitcoin is the asset. asset. >> Bitcoin is an asset. Of
course >> Avalanche is the infrastructure. >> Um >> Um >> Um right. Lily would
say that and it's like it's it's a great sound bite. Um, Solana is a
is an infrastructure for one one chain and there is absolutely nothing that's compatible between
Solana and Bitcoin. Bitcoin. >> Um, whereas Avalanche is really a network of networks and
it's very different from Solana and Ethereum. So, so we

are the technology, we are the rails uh for uh for other assets to uh
to flourish on and I'm really excited about that future. You share with me some
very difficult moments that many people are not aware of. While many only saw the
man behind the blockchain valued at tens of billions of dollars, you spent three years
managing a family health crisis with cancer affecting two of your family members. members. >>
Oh, right. >> All while running the most successful one of the most successful companies
in crypto and all during COVID. >> Yeah, that was

a rough time. So, uh I can tell you what happened. Uh you know, it's
not something I've shared. uh much before but uh let's see uh 2019 about well
2018 or so uh my father got diagnosed with cancer and uh um I had
uh I had a family member taking care of him and uh and I was
going back to visit him regularly. Uh but then that family member also got sick
also got diagnosed with cancer and so that uh that was actually very rough and
then COVID came along just all about at about the

same time and um so I spent a couple of years uh uh you know
flying back and forth uh trying to uh take care of my my ailing father
and um all the while you know with with essentially other family also suffering from
from a pretty pretty awful disease um and dealing with the difficulty of traveling during
co um and and and you know essentially trying to help people who are even
a compromised during COVID. So I would travel, I'd be in quarantine, I'd be living
in Airbnbs because you know you can't just go to

the regular house. Uh I'd be in quarantine in the Airbnb and uh spend the
requisite number of days then go to the hospital and you I've got two people
in the same hospital at the same time sometimes. It was a very very rough
time. What did you learn about life and >> the fragility of our existence and
even you know a lot of money involved in your business. business. >> Yeah, >>
Yeah, >> Yeah, >> but you realize that probably it's just money and it doesn't
help. >> That's just money. I like that I was

never motivated by money when when I got into this space. Um so uh the
things I learned I I learned quite a lot about uh about family, about values,
about what is important to people, what ought to be important to people. um how
resilient people are and um and uh and how much strength anyone can have, anyone
can muster up under duress. So um uh yeah, it was a it was a
it was an eye opening time. time. >> What did you change in your life
after that. that. >> Um through that it's a slow

process of transformation. It wasn't a, you know, it wasn't a flip or anything, but
uh, you know, before then I I was uh, you know, I was a more
sort of a standard kind of person, right. Like people would ask me like, "Hey,
what do you do for fun. " And I would have an answer to what
I did for fun. And then there was this long period where I just couldn't
like what what do I do for fun. I don't know. Um, right. Uh who
am I. I cut away a large portion of how

I defined myself because I just didn't have time to to dedicate to it. and
uh and uh and I suddenly found a new a new identity, a new set
of things that really deeply matter to me. Not a new one, but you know,
I realized what set of things actually matter to me. What really makes me me
and it's not the hobbies. It's not what I do. And um and that really
uh that was eye opening. That was really eye opening. And um and what's what's
really important um just comes to the surface when you

are when you're under stress. That's that's when everything comes to the surface. What's the
most important thing to you in life >> these days. Um, it's uh it is
being able to change the world. It's it's showing the world um how it can
be much much better. And I want to prove to all of the crypto naysayers
that crypto is not this evil thing that the things that they hate about big
tech, especially the progressives out there with whom I identify, um they they have this
hatred. A lot of Democrats es uh especially they demonstrated

that they hate big tech and they hate crypto and I want to prove to
them that crypto is the solution to a lot of the problems that they perceive
with big tech. The concentration of wealth that big tech creates that they really rebel
against is something that crypto can address. The uh uh the the data management problems,
the fact that these titans collect our information and sell it and monetize it, that
is something that crypto can can fix. And I want to show everybody on earth
how much better our lives can be if value is

stored on a chain, can be transferred, sold, etc. Uh if we can create new
economies for people, uh the world will be a better place. So that's something that
drives me. That's something that I'm super passionate about. >> We're recording this conversation from
New York New York New York >> on a very hot day. >> Very hot
>> during heat wave. Actually, >> you live here. I do. >> Why does anyone
live in New York. It's a great question. This is the the most the area
with the most regulatory scrutiny. This is the area with

probably one of the highest taxation rates, right. So, uh why would anyone choose to
to to come here and and doicile here and live day and night here. And
um and if you look at blockchain projects, I think you can categorize them into
a couple of groups, three groups. Um, you've got those people who start their project
and go to Silicon Valley. Those are the people who think that what they have
is a tech play. play. >> They see blockchain as a tech tech idea and
they go to where big tech is and they want

to cidle up to big tech and tie into the tech community. These people usually
base their entire existence and their entire chain around this singular simple tech idea. They
have a onetrick pony. They want to hire the kind of talent that can sort
of ride that pony as far as it will go and they'll push their thing.
These projects are never successful. They never succeed because this is not a tech play.
This is a societal transformation play. >> You've got those people who start their project
and they go to a tax haven. You know, they

go to Dubai, they go to I don't know where else, but uh you know,
they go to Austin, they go to a place with low taxation. They're going to
sell their tokens and they're going to get out. Those people have no staying power.
They're not ideologically driven. they're just there to sell things. And uh then then there's
the kind of people that are kind of like us. Uh I came to New
York because this is where the world's value is. This is where the assets are.
The financial assets are right here. We're not afraid of

the regulatory scrutiny. We welcome it. We do everything by the book, right by the
book. And uh we take a lot of technological uh risk by advancing tech, by
bringing science into the space. And and we necessarily don't take any other risk on
any other front. So, um, I'm really proud to be here. I'm really proud to
be a New Yorker. I'm really proud that we have the connections that we do
to, uh, to big institutions that we've we've built so far over the years. >>
You left Turkey to come here to the US where

nothing was working as we talked about before about before about before >> back then.
No. >> And you moved to the US, which was supposed to be where freedom
exists and anything is possible and everything works. works. >> Well, I wouldn't say that,
but things do work better here. And you ended up being debanked. debanked. >> Can
you explain what happened. >> Oh god. Yes, I can explain what happened. happened. >>
So, uh, so let's see. This is not something that I've touched upon in public
too too much, but uh, but yeah, I was debunked.

I was debunked by the Biden administration. I did not know this at the time.
Um, I'll tell you what happened. It's the same day that, uh, that the family
member got diagnosed with cancer, a second family member got diagnosed with cancer. Um uh
on the eve of that day, some guy rang the door. My open door was
some messenger dude handed me something, made me sign it. I got it. I opened
it up and there was a nondescript little letter from my bank that I had
used for maybe a decade and a half. And uh

I had a mortgage with him with with that bank. And in fact, the bank's
regional manager had called me up maybe two months ago and said, "You're one of
our top clients and uh anything you want, let me know. We'll do anything. "
Da da da. He was he was being so nice to me because uh you
know, I had raised some funding for Alva Labs and I was keeping all of
those funds in the most secure most uh uh you know, conservative investment vehicle, which
meant that we didn't really get much, you know, interest

on that money. They they collected a lot of uh you know, a lot of
value off of that. So I was I was doing things very conservatively. They loved
me for it. And uh and so that same bank sent me a letter that
said um you are no longer going to be our customer. Uh please come to
the the the bank to to collect a cashier's check for the remaining balance and
go somewhere else. And I didn't understand what was happening. I was like why why
would I suddenly and out of the blue uh be

uh you know be losing my banking access. And uh so uh you know I
didn't understand the the system uh so well back then either. And so my first
thought was hey I got placed on the OFAC list right list for those of
you in the audience who might not know is this list that the United States
m maintains of people who should not have access to the uh the uh uh
the financial system. So I went to I start googling for OFAC and it turns
out there's a governmental website and you can query the

OFAC list. I started quering for variants of my name and uh and it turns
out you know the old fact list is just like a bunch of names like
you know I don't know Abu Albakir al this all that this just it's just
ISIS okay so it's like a bunch of ISIS operatives and uh I'm looking at
this I'm like like what the hell could have happened I'm I'm a respectable professor
at an Ivy League institution one of the top few in the world and um
how would I end up on this list. Did I

end up on this list. I don't see my name on the list, but but
maybe this is not the most current version. Maybe there's a different version that the
bank is going. Anyway, I was losing my mind. I didn't get an answer. I
called the bank. The bank is like, "We don't know why you're being debunked. It's
happening at a very high level. " And uh so long story short, today we
know what happened behind the scenes. The Biden administration decided to uh enact a policy
of harassment for crypto. They didn't like crypto. And instead

of being mench about it, instead of coming up and saying, "Hey, we don't like
this, change it. " You know, don't do these things, do these things instead. Instead
of setting guidelines, they decided to harass people in this area. And they decided to
put pressure on the banks to push crypto people out. So, this was really, really
terrible. Um the um I mean, what's the I mean, the amount of stress that
these guys created is something that I will never forgive them for. Absolutely. The worst
days of my life were those days and um and

uh I know exactly who was involved and um I cannot wait to primary those
those individuals. I cannot wait to uh uh to essentially the best best revenge is
going to be to watch them use Avalanche as they buy cars, sell cars, buy
property, sell property, buy stocks and all so on. >> Why would they do that.
>> Why would they do what. debank crypto people. people. >> Uh it's uh so
it's it's a bunch of things I think um surely it came out that some
of these people were getting funding from American Banking Association.

Association. >> So it's so basically you have the loop right because the bank is
saying we don't know don't know don't know >> right >> right >> right >>
and basically we cut you out or we cut you off but we are actually
the ones who are kind of lobbying. That that was happening. There's also hatred of
tech and hatred of crypto, which are two separate things, by the way. And I
I alluded to this before. Crypto is a solution to the problems that people perceive
with tech. But somehow it got lumped together. >> Um,

and just lack of understanding and a whole bunch of other things. I'm not going
to say that all crypto is good. Like that is not the case. There are
a lot of scams in crypto, a lot. But throwing the baby out with the
bathwater is the worst thing you could be doing. and then these blanket statements about
oh you know like whether all of crypto is this that and the other that's
just absolutely horrible and uh usually comes from this ludite ludite camp um in in
certain circles in democratic circles uh they just want to

go back to a simpler time and uh um and that you know and they
just don't understand the value that technology brings to them. >> There are a couple
of things. Um so at the moment I think we have the right architecture for
being able to absorb the growth. What we don't have is the front end your
interface my interface to to services is absolutely abysmal and fraud with difficulty. You know
using DeFi is very very tough. So one of the things that we're doing on
Avalanche that uh I'm really excited about are chains powered

by AI. So um instead of chains where the chain has a virtual machine in
it, you interact with the chain by issuing instructions written up codes and so forth
like essentially writing Excel programs. Um instead of that we are building a chain where
you interact with the chain by by specifying something in your natural language. You say
it in French, you say it in Tagalog, you say it in Mandarin, whatever your
natural language might be. You dictate it to the chain and the chain embodies in
it multiple AI agents that interpret your your intent based

on what you said and carry it out if it's if there's a clear intent
that they can discern. So, um I'm really excited about this because it cuts away
a lot of the smart difficulty of smart contract programming. And um wallets have to
change. um the way we interact from with services by going from one website to
another that has to change. There's a lot that has to change and we're at
the forefront of it. Uh we built this um this wallet called core that is
uh designed to address this difficulty. It's it's improving uh

uh every day and I'm really excited about where core will will take us. We
will you know how it will allow regular people to use chain services. services. >>
What's your biggest prediction for next 12 months. next 12 months are going to see
a complete uh reversal I hope of uh of Trump's uh policies. I think there
are a bunch of things that he did initially to get people to the table
to to try to uh strike deals with various adversaries and uh uh the normalization
from that should happen in the next several months. um

as we normalize and go back to a fully functioning uh global economy, uh it's
going to be time again for people to realize, hey, uh blockchain brings brings a
lot of good. Uh the new in again next 12 months, the new regulations related
to both stable coins and the market structure bill are going to allow people to
say, "Hey, I now understand the foundations. I can build my services on the blockchain
and I can digitize my assets. " So, those will make a huge dent. Uh
the days of Vitalic selfies are over. That's good to

have. Uh the days of Trump selfies will come to an end in about about
12 months, in about a year or so. And um and it's going to be,
you know, do or die. Show us show us how you can actually function. No
more promises, no more dangling, you know, technological solutions to this and that. Just show
us what you've built. >> Show us what you built. Thank you so much, Amin,
for this great conversation. >> Thank you for having me. This is all this was
great fun. As you probably know by now, I host
