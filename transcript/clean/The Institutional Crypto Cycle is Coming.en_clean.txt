I do not think institutions are here in size at all. When I think of
institution, I think of the large pension plans, the large endowments, insurance companies, insurance companies,
insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds and there some of those flows have have started for
sure. So the type of institution that I have spent my career with mostly have
still like they haven't even scratched the surface surface surface really. Oh, not at all.
Not at all. Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of internet money and
internet finance. This is Ryan Sean Adams. Just me here

today. David is out, so I am here to help you become more bankless. We've
got Eric Peters on the podcast today. This is our third time talking. I consider
Eric an absolute investing legend. He was some of the first, some of the largest
at the time. Institutional capital, brave enough to buy crypto, back before it was an
institutional asset class, back before it was popular. Now, last time we checked in with
Eric, it was back in 2023. So, Bitcoin was in the 20K range at the
time, if I remember, and ETH was in the thousands.

We were in the midst of Operation Chokepoint. We were under a full frontal assault
by Gary Gendler. We were still cleaning up the mess left by the SPF blow
up. The institutions had largely left. They were gone. Many had thought they had left
for good. We're in a completely different world right now. On Bank list, this cycle,
this crypto bull cycle, we've called the institutional cycle of crypto. And I wanted to
get Eric's thoughts on this institutional cycle, how it would play out. How does Wall
Street actually view crypto in 2025. Why did Larry think

change his mind. who's left on Wall Street to convince and how far will this
cycle actually take us, including from a price perspective for Bitcoin and Ether. We talk
about Paul Tudtor Jones and Ray Dallio, their crypto conversion, how ETFs fundamentally change crypto's
market structure, and why Eric thinks in the wake of the Genius Act, all of
Wall Street assets will become tokenized. And I think probably the most bullish thing that
he said, the big institutional money isn't even here yet. Eric thinks it'll be coming
over the next 5 years or so, and they'll be

buying our crypto assets at higher prices. He talks about why. This is one of
my favorite episodes that we've recorded this year, so please enjoy it. It's a conversation
with Eric Peters, and thanks to the sponsors who made it possible. In the wild

station very excited to introduce you once again to Eric Peters. He is the CEO
of Coinbase Asset Management. He's also the founder and CIO

of One River Asset Management. I think we first met Eric Peters in 2021. That
was our first Bankless podcast with him. And at the time, he was one of
the institutions, one of the few, maybe the first that had actually entered crypto. So,
a lot to talk about today, a lot of things to catch up on. Eric
Peters, how you doing. you doing. I'm great, man. It's great to be back. It's
good to good to see you again. Sorry we're going to miss David today, but
uh yeah, it's great to see you. Yeah. Okay, so

uh for people who don't haven't listened the previous episodes, we did one with you
I think in 2021, another in 2023. Those are different environments, different climates. But you
started with a story of you were one of the first institutional buyers of Bitcoin.
And I also I think Ether and I recall the story you told us where
you were trying to find a way to purchase at the time was that $600
million worth of Bitcoin and Ether back in 2020. And you're trying to do this
on on the quiet and realizing that as an institution

there was like very little institutional infrastructure to execute this trade. uh take us back
to that story because I want to contrast that with where we are today. So
for people who haven't heard, what like what were you doing back in 2020. Why
were you an institution actually bold enough to enter crypto. What what the heck were
you thinking. So um that was a really fun time and it seems quaint, right.
Like $600 million doesn't seem like that much money anymore. Um which is which is
part of the story of crypto as well. It just,

you know, money illusion and over time um money becomes worth less. um not worthless
but worthless. Uh yeah. So at the at the time uh you know we gotten
through COVID right and um I was uh I was running a macro firm called
one river still am um in addition to Coinbase asset management um and we were
searching around for um interesting expressions for this monetary debasement theme that we saw unfolding.
government, you know, borrowing insanely large amounts of money, essentially printing it. And um the
question was, what are what were some of the the

ways that you could profit from that or or just protect your wealth. And um
one of our largest clients, actually UK client, it's all public record. Um their their
CIO is Philip Henry Maxi. True iconoclastic. Wait, Philip Henry Maxi, his last name is
Maxi. is Maxi. His name is Henry Maxi. Okay. Well, that's fitting. You know, actually,
that's so funny. I never even thought about that. Um, we bought a lot more
Bitcoin than than ETH. So, uh, yeah, so uh, so yeah, so Henry um is
a client and, uh, um, they they ultimately made the

plunge and just said, look, this is this is going to be um this is
going to be a really highly convex way to play this theme. So then the
question was, well, how do you do it. And there really there were very few
options. you know, there were some crypto um financial firms um you know, great run
by great people, great firms, but kind of not not institutional in the classic sense.
And we had always done bespoke things together and um and so we just set
out to figure out how to how to make it

happen and do it really quietly because at the time and this is with Bitcoin
at you know 15,000 and uh and with ETH at you know we're buying around
400 or something like My god. Um, and there just wasn't that much volume. So,
like we we ended up working exclusively with Coinbase. Um, we had a a project
called Project Acorn. There were probably seven people within the whole firm that knew what
we were doing. And I actually didn't even tell them the full amount that we
were doing. I said, "We're going to, you know, we're

we're making some purchases and I think they thought we were buying 50 million bucks,
which was a lot. " And, uh, every time we kept wiring more and more
money over, we were like, "Okay, well, now there's another hundred coming. " You know.
So um but but yeah that was uh that was a really exciting time and
uh wow have we come a long way since then just in terms of infrastructure
in terms of trade size and and and yeah just the ability to execute and
you guys were one of the first institutions to kind

of like enter in this way I believe now now it's like that's why I
want to get to this cycle a little bit more because it seems like this
cycle of crypto is being defined by the institutions but going back to that you
know $600 uh million dollar execution Bitcoin right and that was maybe Bitcoin at 15K
or something. So you maybe you like 5x that or or 6x that and you
know what's the equivalent of say a $5 billion entry into Bitcoin. Is that fairly
easy to do today if you kind of like you

know 5 to 10x the the size compared to you know doing that uh back
in 2020. Is the infrastructure institutional infrastructure now set up to execute in that type
of size or is that still kind of like a big amount of money. It's
a big amount of money, but like one of your boys just sold eight billion
dollars worth, right. Um Yeah. So So So that was a Galaxy thing, right. Are
is that what you're referring to. Um supposedly. So this is probably an early Bitcoin
type investor. We don't know who this is. They did

8 billion in trade execution over the last couple of weeks of of Bitcoin, I
believe, right through Galaxy. And that uh sent waves into the market. market. Come on.
Well, you know, we can't disclose these types of things. Um, yeah, of course. Um,
but yeah, so, you know, you're starting to see really, you know, really large sums
trade hands without moving markets dramatically. You know, we're swinging around 5% or 7% or
3%. But yeah, I I think the the depth and liquidity this market now is
it's pretty remarkable. We really didn't move the market. I

did that whole execution. And I I I was working with the Coinbase team, I
mean, literally around the clock using all their latest algos and, you know, all these
things are more advanced now than they were back then, of course. Um, but they
had clearly the the the best institutional uh type desk uh back then and and
I think still do, but I mean that took us 5 days to do it
without moving the market 24/7. And now you could, you know, you could do that
trade in a heartbeat. You could do an OT OTC

trade and really not move the market materially. materially. So, uh, that's one of the
ways that things have changed over the last 5 years is deeper liquidity, you know,
ability to execute on major volume. Obviously, price has been been a big change. I
want to go through some of the other changes that you've seen over the last
5 years. It strikes me that back in 2020, what you were doing as kind
of a, you know, um, an institution, a respected uh, individual asset manager from Greenwich,
Connecticut. And I said the the name right this time,

Eric. So, we got it. We're fully We understand Trafi now a bit more in
crypto. So, that was career risk at the time. It strikes me for at least
a lot of asset managers felt like buying this dark money sketchy internet thing called
Bitcoin was career risk. Now you fast forward to 2025, we've got Larry Frink talking
about crypto. It took Bitcoin ETFs. It feels very much like crypto has invaded Wall
Street. And I'm not going to say it's become consensus, but it has certainly become
accepted. What's happened over the last 5 years to move

the dial so much on that. Can you just describe what it's looked like from
the belly of the beast. That's a that's a really good question. The question of
why is a really good question. I think we could probably spend a lot of
time on that. Uh I think I think Black Rockck's entrance was a big deal.
And uh and look, Larry Frink, if you think about his career, I I mean,
what a what an impressive entrepreneur. He took that firm and he really disrupted the
um the mutual fund industry industry industry in just a

massive way and has made his fortune by doing that. Now most people probably his
age with the type of wealth that he's created they probably I want to say
would gotten fat and lazy but I you know they they probably would have would
have declared victory and gone home. And I think he saw this he rightly saw
this technology as something that could potentially disrupt the ETF industry and made the fateful
decision to just to lean into it. And so I think certainly he's not the
only one who deserves that credit. I think there were,

you know, there were all sorts of luminaries in our industry uh in in trad
uh finance who who had similar views. Um, I mean, Jamie Diamond certainly didn't, at
least not outwardly, but you know, Ray Dalio, uh, who I have a tremendous amount
of respect for, you know, came out fairly early and talked about that, you know,
he is he is kind of a northstar for a lot of the large institutional
investors out there when when, you know, he says, "Look, something like this likely deserves
a place in a portfolio that matters. " Um, Paul

Jones is enormously respected throughout our industry. uh and you know and and there there
certainly are others no need to go through the whole list but you know you
just you started to see people who I think are very savvy investors who saw
this technology platform as likely being an important part of the foundation for financial infrastructure
and if that was the case it was like well stuff will probably get built
on top of these things and kind of like us we looked at it and
said people really do not understand this technology they kind

of don't understand that you actually can store it securely. They don't understand that it's
used for all sorts of things that are not drug dealing and all the like
so many of the misconceptions that that were rampant 5 years ago. You if you
looked if you did real work on them, you're like this is all BS. Um
or most of it is and you couldn't it it didn't take a genius to
envision a future where became more important. And then and so you're like, okay, well,
if there's something substantive to this and hardly anyone owns

it, then the price is probably going to be higher tomorrow relative to today. And
so that, you know, that just draws financial players into, you know, um into investments.
And so I I really think that's what's happened broadly. So you really think it's
been a matter of um you just hearts and minds have changed basically around this
asset class and in some of these key opinion leaders let's call it the Larry
Fanks the Paul Tudtor Jones of the world these have been sort of their hearts
and minds have kind of changed they've seen the investment

potential to to what extent I guess Eric do you think it's also because Wall
Street now has something to sell right so like let's take another kind of maybe
cynical uh take on it it's not that cynical it's just kind of a profit
motive incentive based take which Well, I mean, Larry Frink and Black Rockck, they're going
to change bullish now that they have an ETF to actually sell because then they
can collect fees on that. Maybe that's a simple explainer to the story of why
Trad is bullish because they can tokenize things and they

can launch treasury companies and they now have ETFs. To what extent is that an
explainer. explainer. It is an explainer, but I think it's uh it's a good explainer.
I don't there's nothing to be ashamed about there because I think there are a
lot of things that you can that you could you know quote unquote do in
the world but it doesn't mean that they make sense to do do do and
I think if if the traditional financial players didn't look at blockchain technology and and
recognize that it could be it could allow the financial

system to transact faster and cheaper um potentially far more transp apparently um more securely.
If they didn't see that as the as the underlying justification for doing something then
I would it wouldn't matter. But I think what what is evident with with people
who have spent time looking at these technologies technologies technologies what is evident is that
if they get adopted at scale they will make financial transactions faster, cheaper, more secure,
more transparent and everyone has a vested stake in that. Some of the reasons that
we have had large financial crises have been because financial

transactions haven't been able to happen fast enough. Some of them have been because there's
been a lack of transparency. 2008, one of there were all sorts of problems of
overlever. Um, but one of the largest problems that compounded some of the more fundamental
problems of just kind of overlever and overvaluation was that there was so little transparency
that if you faced if you faced your your counterparty, you didn't know if they
actually were solvent or bankrupt. You had no idea what was on their balance sheet.
In fact, many of the the companies themselves didn't even

know really what was on their own balance sheet. And so blockchain technology, crypto is
can solve all these problems. So I I think that the foundation is is actually
solid. Um which is why Tradfi and people who've looked at this have been able
to envision a future where if you look at like myself 10 years hence, 5
years hence and you go this is going to be used everywhere. This is again
the people who don't see it, they're just it doesn't matter. like eventually they'll see
it and they'll be the guys that pay more for

the things that we're building or buying right now. So that's great. You know, not
everyone has to see it all at once, but that create that's what creates a
you know a a bull market and and pulls people in. So would you say
at this point in Tradfi in Wall Street crypto is now consensus and maybe maybe
there's a way to pull that apart because there are different pieces of of crypto,
different use cases. Of course you have the store of value use case. You know
something like a bitcoin you would argue ether kind of

fits that as well. And then you you also have you know stable coins you
have tokenization and different subsets may or may or DeFi different subsets may or may
not be consensus versus contrarian but on a whole is it kind of broadly accepted
that crypto's here to stay. It's going to be a big deal and we have
to adapt our uh financial firms to fit this accordingly. We have to have a
crypto strategy. Is that now consensus. I think that with quite a few people at
large financial firms, it is they would say it's obvious.

obvious. I don't know that it's a I don't know that it's fully a consensus.
I think that one of the one of the great things about crypto markets uh
and and also it's somewhat frustrating is that and and Jay Clayton who was uh
was one of our adviserss uh he was the one who really helped me see
this um early he was a former SEC chair Mhm. um before he he joined
us and uh he said crypto is the first financial innovation innovation innovation that started
basically on main street. It did not start on Wall

Street and the consequence of which which is a really simple statement but I think
actually quite profound. So if you think of all the frustrations and the misunderstandings and
quite frankly a lot of the fraud and the bad actors that have really harmed
this industry or at least set us back. I don't it won't do lasting harm
but it you know s the Sam Banks of the world certainly set us back.
back. Yes. But if you look at kind of all of the things that have
happened that um that traditional financial players have just resented

or pushed back on, I think it's because it started with, you know, it started
outside of their industry. So it never it was never regulated out of the start.
If you think about mortgage bonds or CDOS or all sorts of derivatives or swaps,
um all of these things started within the financial industry and and this this whole
you know crypto started elsewhere and as a result we've just had a very we've
had a very different path and the consequence of that is that most of the
most of the older people who have been at these

financial firms that naturally are the most senior are probably the most conserv conservative in
general. They've just stayed away from crypto, but now they they've missed this massive move.
And it's hard for people when they misunderstand something and miss something and particularly when
they're very successful people, it's hard for them to just be like, you know what,
I was wrong. I move on. Like I I've been wrong so many times in
my life and career that it doesn't really bother me that much. And you'll see
the same thing with guys like Paul Jones. Like people

who can flip, they can change their opinion three times in a day. Those are
the those are like that category of people are the ones that have really gotten
on board. But these these you know bankers that don't usually don't have to admit
mistakes and things like that. It's been really hard for them to get on board.
And yet, I think an increasing number of them are saying things to me like,
"Yeah, obviously this is the future, but I still, you know, my board's still not
on board or, you know, maybe they invested in Celsius

and they lost some money or, you know, whatever. What there's there's still excuses for
them to not fully embrace it right now, but it it is so obviously coming.
" You said something there that I want to just uh drill into and just
get your kind of uh because one of the benefits I always enjoy talking to
you, Eric, is you you have this wealth of um experience, just investing experience, right.
But you said someone like Paul uh Jones can kind of change his opinion three
times in a day. So, and the importance of being

able to change your opinion, look at your blind spots and say, "Okay, here I
was wrong. " That's important. And that caused many in traditional finance to miss out
on crypto. How do you balance that. the idea that you want to evaluate things,
re-evaluate things, change your opinion multiple times with the other thing that seems important around
crypto or any investing in general, any asset class, which is conviction. I have trouble
wrestling with this in my own head because, you know, sometimes I uh I want
to change my opinion on things and yet sometimes I

like I re-evaluate it so much that I can almost sigh up myself into selling
assets that I truly do believe in just because a whole bunch of people don't.
So, how do you balance kind of the conviction element as an investor and actually
being able to open your mind to new information and like not be a bag
holder of things that are like obviously never or maybe it's not obvious are never
going to return. How do you how do you balance these things. I guess that's
what I'm asking. That's the art of of investing and

uh and trading and you know investors generally have a longer time horizon than traders.
than traders. Uh there's some people who are pretty good at both. Um but oftentimes
you'll find that um that people who are really good at one are just not
very good at at the other. And really successful ones will admit that be like
I'm actually you know someone might say I'm actually a really good investor. I am
a terrible trader. Like if you look at my decisions to get in or out
of something it is always at the low or it's

always at the high and um and if I change my investment thesis I'm getting
out the wrong time. And so I don't trust myself and therefore I kind of
don't trade. And but that's it's a it's a very very hard thing to do.
I mean look at you. You I mean I I wouldn't call you the most
objective person in the world when it comes to ETH. Right. So you you have
incredibly high conviction. ETH like I've lived the ETH journey. You know I was the
you you were a buyer before. I was but like

I was a buyer at 400. I lived lived it all the way up to
4,800 and all the way down to, you know, very low levels. I don't know,
1500, whatever. And then, you know, here we are back again. And I think we
probably go quite a bit higher. But I think it's it's a lot of uh
the people who who can kind of do both credibly, I think, do a good
job of of identifying the time horizon that they're focused on because it much of
it is about time horizon. You can be a long-term

bull on any asset, crypto assets, Bitcoin, Ethereum, whatever it may be, and you can
be bearish in the short run. Um, I my wife jokes with me all the
time, like I've called ETH a dog for so long, as it has been, but
like, but I but by the way, it hasn't gotten me bearish on ETH over
the long term because because because we're building things on ETH. Like I I you
know, we could talk about that later perhaps, but one of the things that was
exciting for me to sell One River Digital to Coinbase

is that the things that we were building that were financial infrastructure, I thought would
have a much higher probability of seeing the light of day and really scaling across
the industry if we were part of the 800 lb gorilla. And that's actually starting
to play out right now. So like I've lived the journey of like building things
on ETH for to 5 years at this stage and now you're starting to see
it's like okay the whole financial system is going to move I believe to uh
to ETH and uh you know as just a foundational

layer and so if you have that conviction and you kind of see things unfold
you could it's fine to be like this thing is such a dog and it
was like everyone hates it but you you kind of knew that or at least
I did that there is a future that's out maybe it was like 6 months
maybe it's 3 months maybe it's a year two years where where things are being
built on this are going to start to get announced and Wall Street's going to
come to it and then you're like all right well

I don't know what your valuation model is but if people start really using this
across the financial system it's going to be the price is going to be higher
than it is today particularly when everyone's so bearish so you know you have to
kind of weigh that your time horizon with some of the near-term frustrations you have
and you have to be careful that you don't get yourself too overlevered because then
it number one you can get stopped out but but probably even more importantly it
throws your mindset off like if you're just if you

if you can't hold out in your mind this longer term thesis you can ride
out the thing that those periods where it goes against you. It's almost in a
weird sick. It's It's like almost sick in a way, but it's almost fun because
you just see people like you you see the people who are getting all beared
up and they're like, "This thing's going to zero or whatever. " You know, just
kind of stupid stupid statements and then you're like, "Okay, actually this is it's going
to be fun to watch it on the other way.

" But you can't do that if you if you're not thinking objectively and and
so and if you oversize something or you overlever then you won't there will be
a markets do a great job of of finding your pain thresholds and so overlever
makes them um closer to at the money if that makes sense. It's so interesting,
right. Cuz like I I definitely have the longerterm holder kind of um orientation to
me, investor, not not a trader. And there's a unique type of uh pain that
one feels like the high conviction hold pain when the

thesis that you think is not working out and everyone hates it and the price
continues to dump and dump and dump. And I found at least for myself, maybe
this is um a bit sadistic here, but or maybe it's an attribute of a
high conviction holder that you have to have. You start to almost enjoy a little
bit of the pain. You know what I mean. You're just like, "Ah, I know
that feeling. I know that pain. Everyone else is wrong. " You know, like and
I'm still going to hold because I'm using the asset,

because I see the road map, because I see the potential. And then the thing
about high conviction holding is you um the worst mistakes I've made is getting out
of the market because I've been doubtful. and then suddenly it hits and there's this
step function change and you don't have time to re-enter. The high conviction holder doesn't
have to worry about days where you know we get a you know a double
digit uh pump because they're always in the market and that's a piece of it.
Maybe maybe getting back to Trafi here for a second.

So you mentioned maybe some of the reason TRFI didn't see crypto in the early
days was this not invented here syndrome. I'm also wondering because we've talked about this
before in the podcast. I is there was there also another element of it's been
a long long time since tradfi last thought about base money like the concept of
money I mean I went to you know business school I did that all that
whole training they teach you nothing about kind of like base money the uh mimemetic
side of what money actually is all kind of assumed

that we're in a dollar world dollar based system and maybe there used to be
a gold standard but now we've evolved and humanity has evolved olved and now we're
on the dollar and they don't teach any of that stuff I guess. So to
what extent do you think the story of money has had to permeate into tradi
and they've had to re-evaluate their assumptions and think about this maybe that's a reason
they were partially blind for the first decade of this whole crypto thing. That's a
really interesting um way of looking at it. I um

I think that there's probably probably truth in that. Um, it's a little hard for
me to distance myself from the industry in the sense that I've always thought about
money. It's just been really interesting to me. Not, you know, not money cuz I
just love money for for money, but just like the the whole the nature of
like what is it what does it really mean. Um, so, you know, I've read
a lot of books about it and have um just kind of marveled at it.
I I think it's just because it's it's this it's

a really the more time you think about it, it's like this really odd concept.
It's just this collective faith in something that kind of doesn't mean anything. And yet
you look around the world and people exchange their life like literally. I mean lawyers
are the worst with that. Like you're literally saying how much money do I want
to make in my life. This is how many billable hours I have. Which and
think about what you're spending. You're spending what. Time with your kids. You know, things
you could be doing elsewhere. You're spending units of your

life. Basically, you're spending your time, the most valuable thing you have for in pursuit
of this thing. And and uh and then you can think about you can think
about money as this. It's almost a battery. It it it stores time. M time.
M um it stores time cuz right if you have if you have a lot
of it if you accumulated a lot of it if you invest well and you
compound it then it equals time that you would have to have spent making it
or time you didn't spend with your family or whatever

it is that you value you know to do with your with your time and
some people value being able to work. So, but it's it's a really it's a
really interesting thing. I hadn't thought about that as maybe the reason why broad finance
struggled with crypto. Um, probably because I think about money so much and what it
what it means. Um, it's fascinating. I mean, it's one of the reasons that I
have I've loved crypto and and it make kind of makes sense to me that
I would have ended up being heavily involved here. That's

why I feel like Eric like Ray Dallio was a um a good win onto
the crypto side because Ray Dallio from everything I've read from him he is somewhat
he's a traditional investor who deeply thinks about the subject of money you know what
is what is M1 what is M2 and these kind of cycles of how that
switches and can become you know kind of a switch back from a fiat-based money
system to a commodity money system and so some level he'd always just been like
oh gold is the thing and now to see him

start talking about crypto on the crypto train. It just it feels like it fits
perfectly. perfectly. The other thing about money though, you know, it doesn't you don't have
these big monetary shifts that happen frequently and they they tend to take time and
then they accelerate and they can happen really fast. Do they get it now, do
you think. Do they get what this whole crypto thing is. You know, it's not
just like because there was a time where we thought Tradi was getting it. This
is back in like uh 2016 20. It was like

but it was a blockchain not Bitcoin type era and I was like oh you
tradi is getting entirely wrong. They think this thing is just a database technology or
something or it's an open ledger technology and it's far deeper than that. Do they
now understand it in this kind of second wave of of institutional adoption here. I
think most people in Tradfi are not thinking about crypto as money. Um, I think
that they're I think one of the reasons that Tradfi has finally wrapped their or
begun to wrap their heads around it, why you're seeing

more and more interest in infrastructure like Circle being an infrastructure play, Coinbase being an
infrastructure play, is that they're seeing uh they're seeing stable coin as being this killer
app that is, that is, that is, you know, maybe it's a different version of
like it's it's blockchain versus, you know, Bitcoin. Uh, and they're I I don't I
don't think that people in Tradfi think that that Bitcoin is going to take over
the dollar or going to be the next payment system or anything. I think they're
just looking at it and like, okay, this is this

technology is faster, cheaper, more secure, more transparent. You can have programmable money. Um, it's
going to be dollar-based or it's going to be uh R&amp;B based or it's going
to be euro based or it's going to be whatever, you know, whatever the the
sovereign currency is. And um I think that's how people wrap their heads around it.
There's just a very very small portion of Tradfi people who think Bitcoin's going to
take over the world for instance. And I think that that's healthy incidentally for for
this whole industry because at at the like when when

I first saw Bitcoin, I actually I actually thought it was way too big a
threat for threat for threat for I remember you saying this back back when we
first talked for for the US or or for whatever whatever sovereign system where one
of the you know one of the things that governments accumulate is power and they
rarely rar literally shed it unless they're forced to. And so one of the great
powers that they have is Senior Edge being able to essentially create money and for
free more or less. And so it was like h

how will they let something like this actually work. It's way it's way too powerful
an idea. And there was only a very narrow path that that allowed I think
Bitcoin to break through. But I still think that they have the tools to prevent
Bitcoin from just taking over the dollar. Mhm. Um and and so now that like
this technology, the industry, the smart people within it have kind of found that path
for really wide integration across the financial system which is dollar stablecoin and dollar stable.
So and now that we have the genius act and

dollar stablecoin is actually doing more transactions than say mastercard or visa which is an
amazing statement because what is it doing. It's just all trading within this crypto economy.
But now like imagine what's going to happen which is that now that now that
we have clarity around dollar stable coin the question is well what will what will
trad five find to allow those dollar stable coins to buy other than just crypto
and the answer is and the these are things that we've been working on you
know there it's it's going to be bonds it's going

to be stocks it's going to be all sorts of it's commodities all sorts of
everything will get tokenized now uh and be I shouldn't even say tokenized. we like
to to talk about is, you know, issued in digitally native form because we don't
need to have two parallel. We don't need to have the old kind of paper
database system that, you know, that then has just a token attached to it. And
so the the infrastructure that we've been working on for four years is, you know,
allows the digitally native issuance of these TRDFI investments. That's

what's all coming and I think that's what's going to be built on on uh
Ethereum and that's super exciting and you'll probably create global markets that will have different
regulatory you know regimes that sit on top of them and there'll be all sorts
of things that have to be built to stitch together a global market but you
now h you're now going to have a really consistent technology that's going to connect
global markets and so I think when tradi players are getting excited about this it's
not because Bitcoin's going to take over the dollar. It's

because of that whole latter thing that I just described. described. So back I do
recall back in early days of talking about this, you did always see a risk,
a threat of ba basically US government or some government power squashing this whole crypto
thing before it, you know, strangle it in the crib, that kind of thing, right.
Do you think we're fully on the other side of that. So it does seem
that the threat is no longer to the dollar. That's not just not on the
radar. They're fine with with some of these crypto assets

being alternatives to gold because that's not particularly threatening to them at this moment. And
then they see the big win, at least the US has seemed to see this
big win in stable coins, which is just a net new buyer of treasuries, which
is a huge win for the US system. All of these things put together, right.
Of course, we have the crypto favorable administration at this point in time. We have
some good crypto regulation going forward. The Genius Act is the first. Are we over
the hump. Is this now. Have we uh entrenched crypto

so much in the global financial system, in particular maybe the US financial system that
even if there was a hostile administration at some point in the future, it's kind
of too big to to shut down or fully quash out. Have we fully crossed
that that um uh you know hurdle to you. I'm still processing the the image
of strangling in the crib. That was just a really um I think I think
um the honest answer is is I don't know. I mean, and I say that
I say that because at the end of the day,

governments have enormous power and um and so could I envision a hostile administration that
that came in uh and tried to strangle the baby in the We wouldn't be
a baby any longer. It be have to wrestle with a teenager or something like
that. That's the right point. I think that um we could have a much more
hostile uh we could have a much more hostile administration. I think that we pro
I think this administration is probably the only realistic hope that crypto has uh to
be able to scale out in the US a infrastructure

that is that is open and permissionless. I I sincerely doubt that we're ultimately going
to see that out of Europe, certainly not China, you you you know, the big
places that matter. I think that, you know, a lot of the spirit and ethos
of crypto just being representing freedom, liberty, these are deeply held American values. And I
know that I know some people think that some of those values are are under
threat. I would say that in the last administration they were under enormous threat. And
so I think we now we now actually have an

administration which is is you know kind of almost promoting this and recognizing which is
something that we had said all along when we were advocating with regulators and and
with um policy makers is that like crypto really and and kind of private sector
dollar stablecoin really represents these core US beliefs in freedom and liberty. And why would
we ever want to kind of chase China down this really dark path of central
bank digital currency where you can kind of where you can just turn people off
financially. financially. I think it's a it's a very dark

world. So wouldn't it be great if the US kind of led and said, you
know what, with freedom and liberty, we're going to kind of promote this this financial
infrastructure that could effectively get exported throughout the world. Now, other governments could could try
to shut it down, make things illegal, but at least if there if like the
most powerful country in the world is is pushing this technology for its citizens first,
but then out into the world, we probably have a lot of influence over that.
And that's, you know, in terms of of supporting human

liberty, if you have no financial liberty, you're screwed. Uh you might think you have
all the liberty in the world, like you saw this in Canada with that trucker
strike. Um you know, when you start turning people off financially, you can destroy their
lives, their livelihood, their businesses. I mean, the the amount you don't even have to
exert that control directly. Just the threat of it gives government, I think, an unhealthy
amount of control. So I I think we're we're really I think we're moving in
in a great direction and this is the opportunity in

this administration to roll this out fast. Now the good news is that the Trady
players are now racing ahead. you know, the the horses left the stable and everyone's
racing and running and now you're going to see, you know, you're probably going to
see companies trying to screw one another and, you know, uh that um if you're
a startup company, you're going to have Tradfi saying, you know, advocating with regulators not
that let X Y or Z company move as fast as they are because the
race is really on right now. I think in over

the next few years so much will be accomplished that even a hostile administration can't
roll things back to where it was but they can you know governments can always
make you know make life miserable um or or and I should even say that
that's a value judgment. Governments can exert enormous amount of control over individuals and industries.
I think I love the direction that we're that we're heading right now in this
industry. I think it's great and I think we'll take a lot of ground over
the next few years and as that gets embedded within

Tradfi it'll be really hard to change. We certainly have some tailwinds from government from
the US government which we've never had in crypto and you know uh in the
best of times previously it's been neutral but in some of the worst of times
it's actually been massive headwinds and we didn't talk during this dark period of you
know uh 2023 2024 I think we talked you know maybe once uh or something
like that back in 2022. What were you thinking during the operation chokepoint era things.
And it wasn't just operation chokepoint of crypto getting kind

of squeezed off from the banks, of course. It was just a hostile executive branch,
let's say, in the wake of Sam Bankman Freed and all of these things. We
had a very hostile SEC. We had a hostile FDIC. We had a hostile, you
know, Treasury Department. All of that has shifted and shifted over the past year. But
during 2023, 2024, in those dark days, were you kind of thinking, okay, this crypto
thing, like I'm not even going to put words in your mouth. What were you
thinking at that time. For the first statement is that

uh you know, Chepoint 2. 0 was so real. Um, you know, we got acquired
by Coinbase and in pretty short order, we were trying to pull on pull on
pull on all of our our kind of best relationships across Tradfi to help figure
out banking relationships and banking lines and all sorts of things that were really being
denied. I mean, it was it was it was that was government overreach in such
an an unethical um undemocratic way. um that at the end of the day I'm
like I'm a bit of a rage against the machine

kind of person. Um so at my core I'm like maybe I'm a little bit
too old to to come across that way but I I like I it pissed
you off. Like in equity, government overreach, um these things they just I see red.
So I mean I guess the biggest thing is I never I never sold into
that. Um I and I I just kept building and I I felt my level
of conviction was that these technologies were ultimately going to replace traditional financial infrastructure never
wavered because it's it's it's like when in human history

have have techn technological innovations just been stopped by politics. They just haven't. They they
tr now you can you can make you can find situations where maybe not the
best technology of that category one. category one. Um but but governments have not been
able to hold back technological innovation. innovation. And so I figured that we would eventually
get there. It could be a really rough road, but I've career-wise I've traveled a
pretty rough road for a long period of time. And just as someone who's who's
kind of principled about these things is like we're gonna

we're gonna win because the technolog is on our side here. Um it might take
longer than than we expected, but it's it's such an obvious play. In other words,
like relative to traditional financial infrastructure, building everything ultimately on um Ethereum with layer twos
and all sorts of things that we don't we still don't even know that will
get built that will I think be really exciting. Vitalik on your your podcast was
talking uh just about you know the importance of privacy. Like there can be so
many things that I think end up getting built on

this infrastructure where it's so much more reliable, antifragile and in a world of AI,
I think we have this this technology that is going to supply this source of
of truth uh or at least the potential to access like what what is real,
what is authentic, what is true. And so like when you look at all those
things, you're like, "Okay, so Elizabeth Warren is a nightmare. " And I to this
day, I mean, I've I know a lot of people in DC and I know
a lot of theories around, you know, why the Biden

administration was the way they were, why Elizabeth Warren was the way she was. It
doesn't really matter at this stage. Joke Point 2. 0 was very real. we got
through it and uh it'll be harder for that to kind of come back. But
yeah, as I lived through it, I was like, this is it it was it
was in a sick way. It was like this is really fascinating because fascinating because
fascinating because you know if you're a a lay person which I am across pretty
much every field you know you you read you pick

up the newspaper and you read about I don't know biotech or you read about
what's happening in healthcare or you read about what's happening in defense it it's like
you don't really know that much about it and it's fun to be in something
where you're like okay I'm right in the middle of it and I see how
government is is really being awful here And I think there's no there's no kind
of freedom loving person any anywhere in the world who if they were subjected to
this wouldn't react kind of the way that I am

at just I'm in the middle of it. So now I can see it and
it's a it was a great learning experience and it it you know it allows
me to pick up the newspaper and read about other industries and hear about perhaps
injustices or regulations that are overbearing and be like okay I I have more knowledge
and insight into that because of what I live through and what we live through.
I completely agree with you those are my takeaways as well. And what what was
it was surprising to me the the depth of sort

of um hostility that the US government um you know like had for crypto elements
of the government during those dark times. But it's also been surprising how fast we've
180. And I want to talk about maybe the last uh 12 months or so.
And you tell me, Eric, what is the most significant thing do you think that
that's happened on the regulatory government front. Uh back to these these tailwinds into crypto.
We've had the genius bill signed. That was a big deal. We've had a chokepoint
being unchokeointed. So, you know, crypto companies are no longer

being debanked. And even from a rhetoric perspective, you you get talk of, you know,
the US being the crypto capital of the world. So, we've got all of that
uh side of things. You've got a what seems to be a fantastic SEC right
now under Paul Atkins and this whole project crypto. uh you know with the brains
and the intelligence with with um Commissioner Hester Pur to actually pull it off where
all of these fantastic ideas to tokenize things. Seems like so many good things are
happening in in the US from a Tailwind's perspective. What's

the most significant to you. Well, for starters, I have to say I love Hester.
Um and I haven't even met her. I just man I love her spirit. It's
it's it's amazing. And I think this new SEC chair and project crypto are phenomenal.
The the the notion that that we now have room to have kind of a
sandbox um for innovation super important like how the US hasn't always had that is
is kind of stunning to me. Um in fact when so when we started building
out our infrastructure we originally called it one bridge when

when uh it was at one river and and and the the the so I'll
tell you a little story about this cuz I think it it plays into Genius
Act and what's happening with stable coin. So when we first entered crypto, it was
a macro trade as I described earlier. And then I kind of like any macro
trade. You you when you have a big position on, you pay a lot more
attention to it. And so really kind of dove into the technology and said, "Okay,
this is the future. " And so what does that

future look like. And I looked at all of the the the DeFi um applications
that had been built and I felt like they probably wouldn't be what the future
looked like. They were really it was really cool technology, you know, exchange technology, lending
technology, but there were a host of reasons that I thought it wouldn't really scale
into the the bigger markets. And so we just said, let's look at kind of
what has been built and let's let's build out the ability to um to issue
uh digitally native securities native securities native securities that would

be compliant that we felt like regulators would accept. And so we started that out.
So it was called one bridge kind of bridging crypto and tradi. And then uh
and then it really kind of started growing. And we had brought as I mentioned
uh Jay Clayton the former SEC chair onto our board. Kevin Hassid who's now part
of the Trump administration was on our board as well and we really looked at
it and my instinct was let's figure out how to create digitally native really complex
securities securities securities and and Jay was like no this

is just or actually what we did is we laid out the the array of
things that we could do really complex all the way to really simple which is
tea bills and and he's like we I thought we should go complex and he's
like no 100% T bills because they're still boring. I mean, there there's these short-term
discount notes. He's like, that's exactly we need because the first thing that needs to
happen is we need to get clarity on stable coin so that we understand what
digital dollars are, how they're regulated, how they kind of

become part of the financial system. And then what and then what you need to
do is you need to figure out well how are they used to integrate with
other traditional financial products. And you're going to start at the the simplest kind of
highest veloc velocity instruments and then as you get confident as the financial system gets
confidence with that and you see the benefits then you'll move out to these really
complex securities. So that's how that's how we started building um and that's what we
are doing uh at Coinbase now which is super exciting.

So, it it's like how do you bring how do you bring stocks and bonds
really onchain and al and and all sorts of other financial instruments and I think
Coinbase is going to do that at the right pace working closely with regulators and
policy makers and is really going to do it right and um and so it's
fun to be part of that. Now, how does the Genius Act fit within that.
The Genius Act is really the first most important step. So, Dollar Stablecoin had obviously
become this killer app in crypto that had demonstrated that

it can process, you know, $50 trillion worth of uh of of transactions a year,
which is just like absolutely stunning number. And so, it happened without without having that
regulatory clarity. Now that we have that, this just invites all of traditional finance to
say okay now we have this this foundational I say an asset this foundational you
know currency clarity and now we can start plugging everything everything else into it. So
that is in my opinion by far the the biggest thing. Why did that happen.
I think it only happened because of the changed administration.

changed administration. And I think that like my personal opinion is the Trump administration um
felt like they were under siege by many of the same people that the crypto
community felt under siege by. And so there was this there was this alliance in
a way that uh maybe not a formal alliance but like just kind of a
a common view that that direction just is not good for the country is certainly
not good for this industry and so I think this industry got a lot of
support from that and and the political system has come

around to that and I think as as you're seeing us move toward discussions like
I just had there relative to Bitcoin or ETH or Fartcoin or you know whatever
then I I think you you really get traditional finance and you get politicians to
just get behind it. So that that was the Genius Act is super super important.
We always thought it would be and uh and I'm you know I'm very proud
for the advocacy that that Coinbase has had and that we've had over the years
to try to to move in in in the direction

that we've ultimately gotten to. So Eric, I'm I'm wondering as you were talking about
that, I'm I'm curious to pick your brain on on the road map here of
how you think this happens with real world assets, maybe like a 3 to fiveyear
type timeline or what we can get accomplished, you know, uh up until 2028, right.
It seems like we are starting with the more boring assets, which is and I'm
talking in terms of like quote unquote real world assets, tokenizing real world assets. We're
starting with dollars, right. Simp, you know, very simple use

case. We have 275 billion or so. they're now on chain. The the Secretary of
Treasury thinks that's going to grow into the trillions in a few short years. Okay,
so that's happening. Next, you most adjacent to that seems to be treasuries and then
maybe we get uh bonds of some sort or other other types of bonds and
then we get into what uh security like more equities and that sort of thing.
Is is that basically how it happens and how fast can this happen. I think
it will I think it'll start happening pretty quickly now.

Um and we're we're you know we're in it. So like if you think about
what we what we were building with one bridge that you know went to project
Hamilton like when we renamed one bridge project Hamilton went to the Fed went to
the TBACK the treasury borrowing advisory committee um we presented everything that we did. This
is during the last administration and we we encountered um we had multiple meetings. We
encountered staffers and people there who were who were really intrigued by what we did
and yet it was it was apparent that that we

were facing that we were not welcome in the US. We actually um went and
looked globally for what we felt was the most credible regulatory uh agency or environment
uh to go and build offshore because they're like, "Okay, we'll eventually come back onshore.
" I was sure of it, but we might have to wait another administration or
two. I don't know how long it will be. Wow. But again, you can't stop
you can't stop technology from uh it from its ascent if it's it's it's just
on that. Eric, was there another jurisdiction that was you

know like are there more friendly jurisdictions than than I guess you know like last
administration is probably a low bar but like what other jurisdictions are friendly to crypto.
We went we went to UAE. We went to Abu Dhabi. And we entered uh
ADGM, Abu Dhabi global markets which is their kind of regulatory entity and we had
a very common vision for you know the for infrastructure should be built on um
on public blockchains. uh and and we and just like Vitalik had said on on
your recent interview with him, you know, he just said

like if you if you concentrate data and the control of data in any type
of centralized authority, you create fragility. fragility. And I think our view was that why
why use this technology if you're just going to kind of centralize it. And if
you have the courage, which we we felt the US should have had to kind
of open it up for um you know, open software, public blockchain, you can put
regulations on top of that. But if you start there, you're ultimately going to have
a much more robust financial system. And um and you

know, AI has made that even more important because God only knows how these centralized
authorities can get hacked. like I don't know how can JP Morgan get hack how
can any of these these central nodes in our systems get get hacked in the
future if you have everything built in in an open way on public blockchain I
think that those risks you know collapse and so we had that view we had
written we had sketched out in a white paper our view for this we we
we went to Abu Dhabi and they actually had they

had sketched out something that was really similar and we compared the papers and and
they're like, "Did you read what we wrote. " And and you know, we had
it dated in such a way that it they they could tell that it wasn't.
And so they welcomed us in there. And so we built out um Coinbase has
called it Project Diamond. We built out Project Diamond. We have we have issued and
matured, you know, 200 discount notes under regulatory supervision in Abu Dhabi global markets. And
they are, you know, these are it's really awesome. And

I I think their view was like, let's use the technology in the way it's
intended to use it. And what Abu Dhabi is trying to do really, at least
in my opinion, is build out the Switzerland of this next century where a place
where east can meet can meet west. Um, where you're bringing in new technologies and
you're doing things, you know, that that maybe some of the other jurisdictions were reluctant
to do, but you're doing them the right way. And so, it's been a phenomenal
experience for us because I, to my knowledge, we're the

only platform that has done things under that type of regulatory supervision. And that just
means you're like with every one of our issuances and and um maturities, we're sending
weekly reports to them, you know, and and they will they will be excited to
work with US regulators, by the way. It's it's not like one is trying to
beat the other. Um but I think credit to them for being they were out
ahead of any jurisdiction globally uh in our opinion. So we were thrilled to work
together. Now, is it Eric, is it smooth sailing to

bring everything that you've developed in Abu Dhabi or other jurisdictions like back to the
US. Do you do you feel like you have clear regulatory line of sight to
go do that. Now, Now, Now, I think we are we're in active discussion with
with regula at at Coinbase with regulators and policy makers. And the short answer is
yes. Um I think you know when you have an SEC chair that is that
is advocating for the things that you just saw um you know the five those
those kind of main five points that he came up

with including regatory sandbox and then you show up and you've built something you've built
something that um that works that scales that is flexible that's that's kind of generalpurpose
technology that can allow for the digitally native issuance of of equities and bonds, all
sorts of bonds, not just discount notes. So, a treasury is a discount note, commercial
paper is a discount note, really simple, but then, you know, mortgage bonds, all sorts
of different types of trady instruments that can be brought on chain through a platform
like the one that we built. Yeah, it's exciting from

a from a government and regulatory uh standpoint. And by the way, like the fact
that we've already done it under regulatory supervision is a really big deal. Um it's
a you know without any any problems, any issues, any flaws. It's great. So I
I think I think there's going to be a lot of acceptance of this. By
the way, just as we talk to people about what we've been up to here,
there's definitely FOMO in in Tradfi where where where people are like they they want
um they want to figure out how to do things

with us on this type of platform. And there are all sorts of reasons why
they want to do it. Some of them for publicity, some of them because it
act they actually recognize this is going to lower costs in their you know in
their business model. So I think it will happen actually pretty quickly now. um it
better happen quickly because who knows maybe get a different administration. So everyone's incentivized to
move fast and I think this this administration is as you can see is moving
very fast and I do hope Eric we have the

leadership like people like Hester Pur definitely give me hope because she is uh very
deep in crypto. I mean she just knows she knows exa she knows what she's
talking about. She's been in this space for a long time and what what I
what I'm kind of hopeful is that we get a kind of a synthesis between
the best of crypto and also the best of tradi. I was going down the
the the traditional finance track a little bit looking at some of these treasury companies
recently in particular these ETH treasury companies and that causes

you to go navigate like SEC filings, right. And it's like there's so much documentation
there. And so what I do is I I'll go and I'll download all of
the SEC filings. I'll put them into an LLM, you know, and and get it
to spit out some information for me. And what's fascinating to me is like a
lot of these disclosures are pretty useful. Like I I'm glad that I know some
of the investors and you know uh how they're compensated and you know how much
of a share and what the what the fees have

been. Uh like some of this information is is very good and some of this
information I don't get in the tokenized world and I wish I did. At the
same time I also see it's like um I mean there's a time lag in
terms of when I receive this data. I have to sort through all of this
paperwork. I look at the legal fees to go list one of these treasury companies
uh on the NASDAQ or on the New York Stock Exchange and it's tens of
millions of dollars just in documentation and listing fees and

investment banker fees and all of this. And I'm like we could just do this
with smart contracts basically, right. like we could file this all digitally and the investor
can keep the transparency that they have with existing SEC disclosures but use the technology
and reduce costs of of cryptocurren I guess what I'm saying is I'm hopeful that
we get a best of breed type world of we get disclosures but we also
get like reduced legal fees smart contracts doing it digital assets doing it and we
don't get this world of oh now we have like

legal paperwork just with a you know uh an IOU on the blockchain do you
think that this type of world is is possible what I'm describing and like what
do you think about that. about that. I definitely think so. I I think that's
where we're going and I think that the you know players that are that are
trying to create that digital IOU on the blockchain I think you know I guess
good for them for for just trying to move quickly. I think our approach at
Coinbase has always been to just try to do things

the right way. M um I I say that recognizing we got sued by the
ACC. At the same time, um at the same time, I I think that that
that is that is why Coinbase is is the 800 lb gorilla. I think we've
really always tried to do the the right thing. And I think the world that
you just described, the marriage of what what what crypto and blockchain technologies can offer
and what you know the all the sorts of disclosures and the things that have
allowed American capital markets to be the deepest most liquid

in the world and like let's not take that for granted. That is an inc
it's an incredibly valuable asset that the US has. People, companies, investors from all over
the world, they generally come to US capital markets to come and meet and you
know buy and I'm not saying meet in person. I mean like if you're a
if you have money and you want to invest, if you need to borrow money
and you know you're someone who who wants to lend, they come to the US
capital markets which is why it just it's so dominant.

But that requires really great regulatory frameworks that give people the confidence that the government's
not just going to take their money. um that if they get screwed in some
way that there's a watchdog that will um that will help resolve that matter and
that they've got you know they've got good courts where you know disagreements can get
litigated. If you don't have all of those things come together and probably five other
things that I haven't mentioned you you're you cannot have deep liquid capital markets like
we have. And so I think crypto is just gonna

it's not going to do it's not it I certainly hope that people in our
industry and it's definitely not the case of Coinbase like we're not looking to dispense
with any of that. We're just saying that there's a more efficient way of bringing
these things together. You shouldn't have to pay tens of millions of dollars to do
the type of transaction that you just described. Like obviously you shouldn't and I don't
think that we will in the future. I think it will it'll all be a
lot faster and it will and and you know the

the concept of smart contract is just a it's like magic from a financial structuring
perspective. So and you can attach all of those disclosures and everything can kind of
can can kind of be saved down into that smart contract or linked to it
in ways where maybe it uses you know less compute. So it's like and storage.
So, um I think that that's the future that we're that we're going to get
to. And I think the other thing is that yes, there will be certain there
will be law firms that aren't thrilled about that because

they're going to make less fees. But there, you know, when you look at the
history of the financial industry, there is no other industry that has spent the amount
of money on technology that financial services has. services has. And I know that that
might seem odd to people, but it's it is a it is a fact. And
as like Wall Street traditional finance has thrown tech at at its industry for many
many decades to and and what has happened, it's like the speed of transaction has
gone up. The costs have just been in this inexurable

decline. crypto is just the latest technology that has that is going to, you know,
take take it all to the next level. So, I think it's a much better
future for finance and it'll look like the one that you described. I really do.
really do. I think it'd be amazing. I mean, can you imagine a world where
basically, you know, a smaller company, there's some path to some sort of IPO, a
tokenized digital asset type IPO where instead of contracting with these lawyers, you basically you
have an AI, right, that just generates you define exactly

what you want and it generates basically the smart contract code, legal code to go
execute this on chain. That type of thing. I mean, maybe the lawyers won't like
it, but why are we allocating our society's cost to all of these legal fees
anyway. There's more efficient uses for this. Um I I want to talk about the
marriage of uh you know two products that have been very successful it seems like
between trady and crypto and that is the ETF. So January 2024 we got the
Bitcoin ETF and that was um that was amazing. It's

like been I believe the most successful Black Rockck ETF ever. I think uh some
of the volumes around this have blown minds. Not too long after that we actually
got an Ethereum ETF. Was not expecting that that would happen and that happened under
the Gendler regime. I have no idea what type of phone call, you know, uh
was given to him to have the SEC change their mind there. But we got
the the Ethereum ETF in the summer of 2024. These ETF products are now consuming
a tremendous amount of both Bitcoin and Ether supply. I

think you know, Bitcoin something like 6%. Uh Ether is is going right up there
too. It's like four or 5% at the time of recording. So can you talk
about the transformation that cryptonative ETFs have actually had in traditional finance markets. So um
some have said that well this actually dampens volatility across Bitcoin because now we have
institutional large institutional purchases and since the Bitcoin ETFs have come out we've seen less
volatility in uh Bitcoin as an asset itself. Just these large US institutional capital flows.
What effect is that having on the crypto markets and

what effect is are the ETFs having on on traditional finance. finance. Incredibly successful products,
which is ironic because they kind of fly in the face of crypto ethos from
a custody perspective, centralization perspective. Um, and and they're huge. Yeah, I think Bitcoin is
7% now. Uh, the Bitcoin ETS, it's it's just they're massive numbers. um they naturally
as you draw more players into a market uh in general the volatility will uh
will decline. Ironically at times as you bring leverage into a market volatility can decline
as well until something goes wrong in which case the

volatility explodes. Um so there but those the dynamics that you described I think are
in play right now. I still from my vantage point I do not think institutions
are here in size at all. So you know the definition of institution um is
you know can vary quite a bit. So I think when I think of institution
I think of the large pension plans, the large endowments, large endowments, large endowments, insurance
companies, insurance companies, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds and there some of those flows have
have started for sure. Um I think when a lot

of other people talk about institutions um they talk about hedge funds um you know
large investment funds um of different sorts different sorts different sorts um corporates um so
so those so so the type of institution that I have spent my career with
mostly have still like they haven't even scratched the surface really really really oh not
at all not at all these As I said, these are the guys that have
just gotten it they kind of got left behind and it was pretty much a
nightmare. The amount of brain damage that I think has

happened across the institutional landscape is severe. So it's like in 2021 2021 2021 there
were multiple like largest institutions across the world there were digital asset working groups that
were you know any had anywhere from like five to 15 people on them. they
were, you know, exploring whether to get involved, how to get involved. And then it
was like, okay, we're going to get involved, but now we have to change our
investment policy statement, our asset allocation. And in a lot of cases, they needed approval
by the internal board and then also the external board.

And then then you had this big bare market and then you had FTX and
you had all these, you know, all these issues and you drove Bitcoin from, you
know, all the way down to back down to 15,000 basically and they stopped all
efforts and they just stopped, you know, they're like there were so many different controversies
and problems and the SEC was, you know, suing everyone and some of them had
policies that they just couldn't, you know, they couldn't deal with any group that was
that was being sued sued sued and they just they

kind of shut down and the people who had formed the digital asset working groups,
it was kind of their part-time job because they they they didn't get hired to
do that. They were and so they just went back to what they were doing
and then, you know, and then obviously crypto's back over 100,000 or is at new
highs, you know, up up over 100,000 and it happens so fast that they didn't
get the position on. So, it's like if you're if you're a if you're a
professional investor, which all these people are, and you put

all this work in the digital asset working group, and then you didn't buy the
and and you said, "This is something that we really want to do, even if
it's just a, you know, a starting position, and then you got a whatever it
was, you know, 70% decline and you you bought nothing and then it's back to
new highs. " that there's a lot of brain damage there. there. It's really hard
to be like, "Okay, you know what. Now we're going to let's let's crank up
the digital asset working group again. " group again. "

So, I think I think what's happened is it's not illogical. What's happened is the
first step that they're trying to make is to say, well, we don't have to
buy the coins themselves. Let's invest in the infrastructure. And so that's one of the
reasons I think that you see something like a circle IPO that goes absolutely bananas
because you got these you've got these large pools of capital that look around and
say well god I am I really going to buy you know Bitcoin at at
100,000 or 110 or 115 or 120 um and even

if it goes back to 85 like they can't they just can't they haven't been
able to do it but they can go out and buy a stock um they
you know and and um and so That's the type of thing that I think
you're seeing. Um, they've put money into VCs, but they haven't really come in. So,
I think that they, you know, that they will, but this this to me, this
is exciting. It's like this is that is exciting. You want a market where you're
where you can look out a couple years and say,

"Yeah, I I know who's going to be buying this stuff from me and, you
know, in in a few years time at what I think will be substantially higher
prices. " You want to know who that is. If the answer is you don't
really know, you should probably be thinking about selling right now, you know. Um, but
there are plenty of people who who I think will will be buying at higher
prices, but they'll first make bigger and bigger investments in infrastructure and maybe in the
end maybe they won't hold huge amounts of these tokens.

I think that they they at least some of them will. Um, and it's it
is possible that crypto to a degree becomes part of some new monetary standard. Not
that Bitcoin takes over the dollar, but that like it's it's possible. You know, you
see the US talking about a strategic digital asset or Bitcoin reserve and there certainly
are are countries around the world in the Middle East who've made large investments that
are probably bigger than the ones that they've disclosed. And so it's possible that there
even do become some monetary standards that are at least

in part backed by by crypto just like they might be backed by gold or
other commodities. And so there could be narratives out there. I think there probably will
be narratives that will ultimately suck some of these big players in at higher prices.
prices. So you're saying the real institutions, the big big institutional money is not here.
That's like pensions, that's sovereign wealth funds, that's, you know, some of the uh like
I guess biggest capital allocators uh in the world. And they're actually not here. And
it's funny to me that you say they got shaken

out by another four-year cycle, right. Like crypto cycle, boom bust cycle because like that's
our expected that's that that's what we being in crypto, that's what we expect. And
every time it just shakes them out because probably they're not used to that type
of a a cadence, boom bust cadence uh in the um in the traditional markets.
But I guess maybe um that that begs the question, do like how high do
you think these crypto assets can actually go. So something like Bitcoin or something like
Ether. So I mean we're above 2 trillion on Bitcoin

right now. And you're saying that's without the big pensions and sovereign wealth funds and
the big institutions entering. We're at above 500 billion or so on Ether at the
time of recording. Um, of course, we don't know how the cycles will will play
out, but what do you think is the ultimate size of this opportunity for those
top two cryptonative assets, sort of the the quote unquote store of value type of
uh crypto assets here. Are we like how far are we in that journey. Let
me tell the story first and then uh then get

to that. So when I entered this space, I kind of arbitr in in late
2020, I arbitrarily said this is going to be 10-year trade for me at the
time. Now maybe it won't end up being that, but that was I was like,
I think it's going to take that long for all the misconceptions that people have
about these assets to more or less be answered. stability of storage um you know
use in for nefarious purposes like all the things that people just kind of got
wrong about these things you know why could these go

up aren't they just isn't it just uh technology couldn't you create you know a
million different Bitcoin protocols and like all these things it's like it's going to take
10 years for most people who don't pay much attention to this stuff to finally
understand it and for the infrastructure to be built so that there really are no
frictions from an accessibility standpoint. And I figured, you know, in 10 years they'll probably
be valued like a lot of other assets in the economy, which doesn't mean that
it it has to go down from there. It's just

that they'll probably be fully valued. So for instance, US economy is $30 trillion GDP
right now roughly. gold market cap is 23 trillion dollars. It's big, right. It's like
all the gold in the world is at this price worth not a full US
uh economy from an annual GDP perspective and Bitcoin is 2. 3 trillion. So Bitcoin
is onetenth of gold. Um and then as you said ETH is kind of half
a trillionish, you know. I know you had Tom Lee on uh recently and he
was talking about well you know ETH could 100x from

here and be worth worth worth 40 trillion guy. 40. So it's like you know
you think of numbers like that is ETH going to be like I I don't
think that's going to happen honestly. Um but I think my my mind is open
to I try to stay open to everything and then just think in probabilistic terms.
So the the story So I think we're kind of halfway through my 10 year
that original still like that tenure. I'm kind of sticking to that honestly because because
because I think that it's playing out roughly how I

hoped and now we have the stable coin legislation. We talked about how like that
leads to all these next steps, right. I I think that it it's playing out
that way and yet so I was I was speaking with um uh someone who
you know close kind of colleague friend who who essentially leads investments for one of
the largest pension plans in it's not a pension plan. It's a uh it's like
a basically kind of a 401k money. This is in a foreign country okay in
in kind of Asia Pacific. It's one of the largest

in the world. And so their underlying clients are pensioners in their country. And this
guy uh is a very forward-looking investor. He's been invested in crypto for years. He
finally got an approval. This is in the past year. year. Finally got an approval
to put in a a very small allocation to Bitcoin. Um and and they got
to a point where the regulators were were going to force them to disclose that.
And so they they called they were really worried about, you know, what are our
what are our clients, our pensioners going to think about

this. And so they they called up and uh they contracted with a crisis PR
firm and they said, "Okay, this is going to be announced. We're worried that we're
going to get influx of people saying, "What are you doing with my money. you
know, why is it in Bitcoin. This is my retirement savings. So, they had everything
mapped out. They make the announcement and they do get inundated with calls and the
calls were could we could can I put all of my money into that product
product and it wasn't a product, but like they so

the the reason that I say that is because I think in I don't think
in terms of price per se. Sure. Like I want to know where relative values
are. So the US GDP is 30 trillion. Is Tom right that ETH could be
40 trillion. I don't think so, but I don't know. Maybe US GDP ends up
being 100. Well, it will someday, you know, 100 trillion because there's a whole bunch
of inflation over the next 10 years and then maybe ETH at 40 trillion makes
sense. I don't know. But I I don't really think

in terms of those price targets. I think that that prices move because there are
more buyers than sellers or there more sellers than buyers. buyers. And when I look
around the world and I hear a story like the one that I just described
where you have this absolutely massive pension pool and they get inundated with calls because
people want more exposure, but they don't have it. That is that is still a
structural friction in the system. Trump just had a he just, you know, signed an
executive order that made crypto essentially eligible for more 401k

plans, also, you know, private equity and other things. But the point is that I
think that we still have a multi-year play where the frictions for frictions for frictions
for for buyers to be able to put money into these assets, those frictions are
going to decline. And as they decline, I think that more money will flow into
them and prices will go higher. And it's a super reflexive reflexive reflexive it's a
super reflexive market. Meaning um one of the this goes back to the nature of
money. One of the wild things about crypto to me

is that if you look if you just look at Bitcoin for instance, like it
could be worth anything. There's no ETH almost the same in the sense that um
if you have someone on who tells you that they have this great valuation model.
I will I will tell you just it's I don't I don't believe I don't
believe that there is one at this stage. I think there may be in the
future as these assets become more integrated across finance. But like there really isn't a
good valuation model which means by the way that's a

blessing and a curse. means the price could go down a long way and you'd
be like, I don't know, Bitcoin at 3,000. 3,000. It made sense not that long
ago. Bitcoin at 123,000. at 123,000. Yeah, makes sense. It feels a little cheap now
that it's trading down at 115. Um, it feels really cheap at 85. 85, if
you go back however many years seemed really crazy expensive, but there's no real valuation
model. Like people try to say, "Oh, network effects and everything. " I think there
will be a valuation model at some point when there

really is. I will I will probably be out of my, you know, holdings. There'll
probably be there still be all sorts of things to do in trading, but but
like we're still in that stage right now where the value could be anything. And
so, as long as you believe that there are going to be more buyers than
sellers, which I do, and you have a market that's reflexive, that isn't bound by
a valuation model. You can't look at Bitcoin at 200,000 and say it's wildly overvalued.
You're like, what valuation metric are you using. And you're

like, I actually don't have one. So you're like, well, okay, it could be that
value. It's it's fine. I think that the confluence of the different themes right now,
so like one of the themes I think is that that is going to drive
valuation is this flow of 401k money. I think that income inequality is actually a
big driver of this because there's so many younger people that don't feel like they
can make it and they have guys like Michael Sailor or Tom Lee talking about
100x and like hell man I could put my money

into some you know crappy stock index fund and earn you know on average 7%
a year or I could make a 100x like I'm I'm going to put a
bunch of money in that. I think like income inequality and some of the frictions
between youth and older people that have a lot of money are going to drive
flows into this. I think the use cases are going to obviously drive drive drive
flows. I but like AI is another like I think we're starting to see this
convergence between crypto which doesn't have great valuation models and

AI which ignites people's imagination in wild ways. you're seeing this convergence where AI is
going to make it so that we don't know what's real and what's unreal and
crypto can help solve that. Like you can you'll be able to authenticate video and
everything using blockchain. So I think but I think you'll also see this AI agentic
economy where you're going to have AI agents um transacting with one another and they
need to move money and do all sorts of financial services between them at light
speed that JP Morgan or these other firms are not

going to be able to do. So you're going to So you're you're seeing this
AI theme with this like inequality youth versus versus uh you know young people theme.
This kind of movement of all these baby boomers that are giving money to their
younger people that's going to kind of drive this this new technology. So there they're
like all these different themes that are coming together. I think that over the next
five years you could you could see like sorry to go back to valuation or
or or price I think in terms of probabilities I

think that there's a 25% probability and and by the way that is is is
like for what I'm about to say is like huge in my opinion of of
something that you know that is like the South Sea bubble type move where you
get these these frictions decline, these passive flows increase in in an into cryptos where
there really isn't a supply response. It's like everything else that humans have ever invested
in. If the price goes up, you create more of it. You don't create more
Bitcoin. The only way you get more Bitcoin, I mean,

you're creating a little bit, but but like there's no big supply response. the the
the rate of mining um creation is not going up because the price doubles or
triples or quadruple. It just doesn't go up. You have to just get people who
currently own it to sell it at a higher price. So, you could you could
see some type of, you know, massive move. I I assigned a 25% probability to
that. I think there's a 25% or there's probably 50% probability that say with Bitcoin
that we're over the next 5 years we're like between

se 50 to 75,000 and 250,000 and we're just like we swing around and those
are still big numbers like again if you you kind of compare Bitcoin to US
GDP and gold um and then there's a 25% probability that we're kind of lower
than that. But I it's probably not even a 25% probability over the next 5
years. I mean, eventually maybe it could get there. It would probably be hostile administration.
It would be I don't know. Some things really went wrong that we can't foresee
um that I can't foresee right now. But there's there's

always a probability that the the thesis is wrong. But like some of the high
numbers could be really high. And uh and I think for ETH I think ETH
is more of a trade by the way just because the the thing about and
and that's not a bad thing by the way but well like the higher ETH
becomes the more expensive it is to transact on it which I think will invite
more innovation to increase speed throughput etc and and you will kind of tend to
to bring that price down. So it could be more

subject to boom bust and you know Bitcoin I think is really will become a
dominant store of value and and over time probably overtakes gold um over the you
know very long term but you know next 3 to 5 years I I could
see I could see some colossal uh upside if you get this you know this
real reflexive mad rush in. rush in. What do you think about these treasury companies.
So you mentioned one of the things is um friction sovereign wealth funds for instance
I was just reading this morning about Norway sovereign wealth

fund and there was a report that they increased their their bitcoin holdings by 80%
this year right and it's just a very small number so 80% increase but when
I looked into it it was actually bitcoin holdings were via strategy micro strategy that's
they they didn't actually hold bitcoin they they held you know m michael sailor's proxy
stock of micro strategy which you know demonstrates I think the friction case but we've
seen micro strategy of course over the last you know four or five years now
we've seen these ETH treasury companies popping up you just

mentioned you know Tom Lee but there's a slew of them them them and they're
really like tracking I mean I I think it's like close to 3% or two
to 3% of all ETH right now in treasury companies and this is just in
the past couple of months and these act as kind of shelling points for the
narrative as well when you have people like Tom Lee on CNBC saying like we
could 100x here you know genius spell stable coins stable coins are on Ethereum ETH
you know number go up all of these things. Do

you think this is healthy for the market. Unhealthy. Do you worry about it. Do
you think it's positive. What's your take on this whole move. move. I think it's
ultimately unhealthy. Um, but it's it's still early. Uh, it's still it's still too early
for them to be materially unhealthy. Um, and the reason I think that ultimately unhealthy
is well, I I thought Vitalik's answer when when you asked him about that, I
think it was perfect. Like I I don't know that guy. I I have a
real soft spot for him. He's such an innovator and

I think he's he's just he just calls it as he as he sees it.
He's like, "Yeah, these these companies, I guess they're kind of creating an something between
an option and a derivative of these assets. " And you can just tell the
way he answers it like he doesn't that's just not what he's in it for,
you know. He's more of a purity guy around what this could do for financial
services in society broadly. And so it's like creating derivatives and options on the underlying
asset. It's like why you doing that, man. Um I

I feel like that that was kind of that was the spirit with which he
answered that that question. I I'm um having spent my career in financial services and
around Wall Street even though I only worked at a Wall Street bank for like
five or six years and I I saw enough. I you know I kind of
wanted and needed out. Um but I think Wall Street has a tendency to take
everything and financialize it, leverage it, amplify it and there are all sorts of tools
that are being used with these treasury companies to do

those things now. And they and by the way they're working. Um and uh but
I think now that you're seeing this proliferation of them I they'll probably like anything
like any kind of array of startups in a new category there'll be some that
that do really well. Um Micro Strategy is clearly the you know the dominant one
but it's MNAV was just like at 3. 4x at one point. It was 2x
not too long ago. It's 1. 6x right now. I just saw that they, you
know, that they they kind of um issued renewed guidance

or new guidance on kind of when they'll be issuing equity. And like it it
feels like the market's doing what it typically does, which is if if if you
get an MNAV that's trading above one for any protracted period of time with these
companies where the the value of the company is, you know, well above its underlying
underlying underlying holdings. Of course, you're going to get financial players that are like, well,
hell, I'll do that, too. I like free. Who doesn't like free money. Um, so
I'll do that, too. And so I think the market

will supply that just like in do you know all these companies that made no
money were trading at crazy valuations and so the market you know in its infinite
wisdom just created more companies until the value pushed down and then you realized hardly
any of them are worth anything and then they collapse. I don't think that same
thing I don't think it's actually the right proxy for these treasury companies because they
actually do do something. They just own the underlying asset. It's not like they have
no business. they just they're kind of leveraged financialized ways

to to own these assets. And so I think in time it's likely that Wall
Street ends up creating at least a class of them that embed all sorts of
leverage into them. They probably suck a lot of fees out from their investors for
the management companies, which I don't think is healthy. But I don't think they'll destroy
the markets. I just think they'll create volatility at some point and they're not super
interesting from my perspective. Like I wouldn't buy them. I saw that um um what
was it. Um uh the Norwegian um the Norwegian sovereign

wealth fund they you know they added a a maybe they doubled their micro strate
position and maybe that was the one that you were talking about. That's what I
was talking about. That's the one you were talking about. It's like they did that.
I'm like I wonder why. I mean they're very smart investors. Like why are they
paying a premium for underlying. It's probably friction. It was probably somebody in the do
you think their hierarchy of the investment committee whatever who just Yeah. And and and
you know I I sent a note around to you

know five or six guys that are that are that are that I I turned
to with a question like that and no one had a really good answer. It
was like well maybe m maybe it's it's such a big portion of whatever the
index is that they're tracking that they're forced to buy it now. Like it's it's
probably something like that. I don't think that they're these are smart guys that aren't
in the habit of buying things that are multiples of underlying valuations. So, um but
but again, there are all sorts of frictions in finance.

Some of them make a lot of sense, some of them make less sense. Um
I I don't I don't think like when the story of crypto is over, I
don't think these these companies will will feature prominently. I think they'll just be like,
you know, something along along the edges. the edges. So, Eric, going back to your
10-year crypto trade, we're 5 years in, so we got five more years to play
out, right. And part of that was uh as you um you mentioned, a macro
trade basically. And so, I'm wondering if you could kind

of forecast the next 5 years of macro. There's all sorts of details we could
get in. What's Powell going to do. Blah blah blah blah blah. I'm talking about
the things that you feel like we can bank on over the next 5 years
that you can bet on. So, like I don't know if it's debasement if that's
a theme, fiscal dominance if that's a theme. I don't know what you think about
US's position in the world, but what are the things that you're basically banking on
that fuel your crypto investment when it comes to macro

over the next 5 years. Uh, okay. I think I think some things that you
can bank on that we're seeing directionally unfold here that are supportive of crypto cuz
like we could talk about macro all day long, but let's talk about the things
that I think really will impact crypto. I think that you're seeing a convergence between
you're seeing a more transparent and overt convergence between Treasury and the Fed. It's that
Ray Dallio thing. It's just it it it Yeah, it's uh I think he's written
a lot about it. It's like what you see in

much longer cycles when you have this much debt and the debt um the interest
payments on the debt are driven by a policy that the Fed is um is
in charge of. Um it's the temptation to kind of merge those two entities is
extremely high. And I would I would have said that once the Fed balance sheet
got big enough, which it did over the last, you know, 1015 years, you whether
you admitted it or not, that the two really were kind of locked at the
hip. hip. And I think there's some political tensions that

are going on right now. But I think that those things will converge. I think
that that that will be good for for crypto because what what will happen and
I think it's a very logical thing for the government to do. If if you
and I were running the government, I think we would converge on this policy which
is that we have a lot of debt in the world and so we need
to grow the economy really fast and we need to keep interest rates really low
and that is um you know that's kind of like

fiscal dominance basically. You're basically the government is saying look we have so much debt
in the world. We can either default on it which they're not going to do
or we can kind of inflate it away. Inflating it away in a constructive way
which I think is what they're trying to do and probably will pull off is
just running the economy super hot but then keeping interest rates really low. And so
the people who want to hold government debt and they basically don't want to take
any risk. they're just like, I wanna I want to

make sure I get my money back. Well, it's like great. You can get your
money back, but you're not going to make very much money with it. And maybe
you make negative money like in a on a real basis, maybe you lose money,
but you don't lose a ton of money. And so, it's like a it's like
taxing the savers. So, I think that that that is happening. And as that happens,
essentially, real interest rates decline. That's great for crypto or it traditionally has been and
I think it will continue to be. So I think

that that's something that you can really bank on. You're seeing that playing out right
now with it some of the tension between Bessant and Powell and Trump and maybe
there's not tension between Besson and Pal really like Besson is a super super smart
guy and operator and knows markets well and so like he like anyone in his
seat would say we could just kick this problem to the next administration or we
could deal with it. And I think he's really trying to deal with it now.
I think it comes at a wonderful time in economic

history because for the first time really in my well in the last 25 years
of my career let let's say post post uh. com in internet which is a
really exciting time for the economy in terms of innovation like AI has the potential
to allow productivity in the US economy and globally to the extent that people adopt
it. It has the potential to allow that productivity to increase significantly. increase significantly. And
if you do that, if you if you increase the productivity of the US economy,
it allows you to run it at a much higher

rate of GDP growth. And if you do that at the same time that you're
holding interest rates down, we could be in five years, we can be in a
place where people are where there there has been essentially debasement of the dollar because
um you've held interest rates low. And so as a result, you know, the people
that have just kind of been in hiding in safe spaces, they have less money
than they they did before. But you could be in a much better place from
debt dynamic perspective. And I actually think that there's a

really good chance that that's where we end up. But that AI theme, for the
reasons we described earlier, I think that that AI theme will fuel crypto adoption and
usage at potentially a wild scale. And I think because AI is this wild new
technology, it also ignites people's imaginations. And so when you have, you know, crypto that
has no great valuation model attached to it, which means it could be valued to
anything combined with AI, which which um will kind of conflate with that theme. I
think that that'll be a really powerful thing over the

next 5 years that that that can really drive these markets. So I think those
are those are the big things I I think we'll get widespread adoption. the Genius
Act was the first part of that that will continue on. So, those will be
the the the big themes. Um, but what throws a wrench in this. Like, what
could go wrong here. It always seems like when we've got it figured out, you
know, like cuz I everything that you you're saying, this is sort of what, you
know, we've converged on, what I've converged on, right, is

just like, you know, fiscal dominance, continued debasement. you want to have these store value
assets, plus you get this upside of, you know, AI, all of the tech that's
being built in crypto and real world assets, all of this stuff, right. But it
just at at some level, it just seems uh too too obvious and too simple.
And maybe we're not thinking about enough about what could go wrong. What could still
go wrong. Trump could lose lose the midterms and and you get a real political
backlash. Um that could happen that would would be damaging.

I don't think it would I think it would create a material correction, but I
don't think it would I don't think think anything's going to derail these markets entirely.
to go back to your Vitalik interview. I think he he expressed concern about these
Treasury companies, which I think again is I don't think they're big enough yet for
this to to be the case, but he was, you know, he was like, "Look,
if you get if you get them big enough and overleveraged enough in some way
that a 30% correction creates a mass liquidation event that

gets down to 50, that gets to 70, gets to 90, then you you dent
the credibility of the underlying assets. " And and I think that's true. I don't
think that that's that's not a today problem. Um it could but it could be
depending on what happens with these treasury companies. We'll see. Could be a a problem
in 2 years, 3 years. Um we got to keep an eye on that. I'll
definitely keep an eye on it. Whenever you have a leverage player that gets big
enough, that person will get stopped out. I can assure

you it is. I've never I've never seen in my career that not be the
case. That happened in the VIX ETNs in 2018. I don't know if you remember
those things. Um but uh yeah, you know, I started in the commodity pit. Anytime
there's someone with a big levered position, they get stopped out. So, but that's not
a today or tomorrow problem. Um so, I mean, there there could, you know, I
don't think that we're going to have a big wide widescale fraud. I think that
the industry's cleaned up from that. there could be um

some type of massive hack as Tradfi kind of gets involved and if they they
don't get their security right, I mean these are bare assets like there could be
problems there. I think that's a big I think that's one of the big plays
for Coinbase is like crypto is a service. I mean Coinbase is the 800 lb
gorilla that is going to supply the infrastructure services to traditional finance as these guys
all get on board. some of them maybe JP Morgan or maybe Goldman will build
some of their own infrastructure but I think you know

Coinbase will be dominant in that space but you could get some lesser players that
you know try to do things on their own and just mess it up I
think that would harm the industry you know big thefts or people feel insecure with
their assets those are the things that I kind of think about you know um
whenever like what really moves markets is fear and greed is people's imaginations running wild
on the upside and but also on the downside and so you know things that
destroy people's faith in these underlying assets. So it could

be a hack, it could be, you know, something with with um you know encryption
that that goes wrong due to quantum computing. But like when we've really looked into
that, I don't think that's going to be a real issue. It's so it's like
but it's the type of thing that it could scare people. Um but I I'm
not worried about at this stage in the cycle. I'm not worried about like catastrophic
downside. I I'm I'm not I There's downside of course. There's always like 30% downside
in any market. You're crazy if you think there isn't,

but I'm not worried about the catastrophic downside right now. Eric, this has been uh
so good. And you know, as we start to close this out, I I I'm
curious for a lot of listeners, you've mentioned Coinbase throughout this episode. You've also mentioned
One River. You're still running One River Asset Management as well, but was also acquired
by Coinbase, I think, back in 2023. This is not the Coinbase kind of maybe
exchange that everyone's thinking of. It it still is part of Coinbase, but it's also
its own separate thing. And I'm wondering if you could

kind of describe what uh your side of Coinbase is. So, what is Coinbase asset
management. What are you guys doing over there. Yeah, so um thanks for asking that,
by the way. But yeah, so I I I started One River. We created One
River Digital as a subsidiary. Coinbase acquired that and left me running both firms. And
the kind of the industrial logic behind that was we all agree that that TRFI
and crypto are going to converge. And having someone in my seat who can kind
of speak both languages um who's out in front of

many of the largest institutional investors in the world all the time speaking with them.
I've been able to be a good translator and and an educator quite frankly. Um
particularly in in the the kind of the dark bare market crypto winter when people
weren't doing a whole lot. It's like these big players were not going to call
up some cryptonative person and say, "Hey, could you come in and you know explain
how the blockchain works. " But I I would be there and they and and
you know we'd be talking about macro and be like

okay I'd say 30% of every conversation was about crypto and where this is leading
and so hopefully we you know we've done collectively our service as a firm to
you know help people understand that. So Coinbase acquired One River Digital and that turned
into Coinbase asset management. So we're wholly owned by Coinbase. Got it. Um there all
sorts of information barriers because we are an asset manager. We don't get to see
what people are doing on the exchange or anything and very thick barriers. We're an
SEC registered investment advisor. Nice. And where we see the

greatest opportunity right now, like we've built out indices, we're doing some things in in
DeFi with capital. The big the big opportunity that we see right now is that
um there are over$ two trillion dollars of Bitcoin in uh that people hold in
the world and most of that Bitcoin earns it's incredible collateral. Most of it earns
no return, you know, no no yield. And so we've we've been developing quite secure
and um interesting ways to help our clients who are sitting on a lot of
Bitcoin earn an incremental yield that can be three five

you know 8% depending on the amount of risk tolerance they have could be even
more than that and Eric when people hear that right so some some people in
crypto were burned by that whole you know 2020 uh2 thing where it was like
you know BlockFi and Celsius and they promised yield on Bitcoin and other assets assets
and of course, you know, it turned out that they didn't actually have the assets.
They were doing risky things. They got blown out on the GBDC trade and all
of that. Are you guys doing things differently. differently. Totally.

And I I would tell you that we um I think one of the reasons
that Coinbase acquired us when they decided to to just go in all in on
asset management is we you know, we didn't touch FTX, Celsius, block, none of these.
like we we literally our our yield products back then returned 100% of their capital
because we were fully collateralized and it's just you know I've I've made my career
really um capitalized into some great opportunities but also being a very good risk manager
and so we have some of the smartest investors in

the world that ask the same question that you just did and we walk them
through how we're generating yield and they're like okay that's that's secure and that's great
and the only reason that we're generating the kind of yields that we are is
because Tradfi has not come full force into this space. And so we'll build out
a great business around helping our clients that are longerterm holders or long-term holders of
Bitcoin earn yield in Bitcoin so they basically can kind of continue to build their
stack. And then also, you know, there are more and

more dollars in stable coin that are earning no yield. And so we are developing
yield products for those stable coin holders as well. so they don't have to leave
the crypto economy and they can earn substantial yields. Um, and so, you know, I
think that we'll probably end up seeing dollar stable coin be like kind of like
the checking account um, of the future and then and then we're building out essentially
the savings account and you'll be able to kind of sweep money into that savings
account and earn, you know, earn very nice yields again

depending on the amount of risk tolerance that you have. We're never like we're not
taking catastrophic risks. But of like of course there are risks if you're going to
receive any reward. There are some risks but we don't you know I'm totally uninterested
in taking any type of catastrophic risk. These are just risks of higher or lower
yields or sort those sorts of things. Is that open to retail now or is
like the asset management stuff you doing or is it all a credittor investor credit.
open retail yet, but you know um obviously I think

some of the industrial logic of of bringing asset manager into Coinbase is you know
Coinbase has a lot of of of a lot of retail customers and high net
worth customers and so I think some someday of course like how could you not
have really high quality asset management services provided to retail of of course that will
be the case but we're we're not there yet. Eric this has been amazing. Last
question just to close us out. What do you think we're going to see. Just
summarize all of this in Trafi institutional kind of entering

crypto. What do you think we're going to see in crypto for the next 12
to 18 months. What should people be looking for. I think we're going to see
a lot of really exciting announcements that um that are showing real use cases which
everyone's been asking for but it's like been hard to do because the regatory issues
and and as those get cleared I think some really great things are going to
start happening with it kind of bringing bonds and and equities on chain and I
think Coinbase will be leader in that space and I

think that'll get people super excited. Um I think this convergence between Treasury and Fed
and um monetary dominance you know will I think it was like these things will
will unfold and I think these assets will you know will continue to do well.
So I think a lot of really good things are happening that are foundational that
will you know that will then help people like their imaginations will start more easily
seeing a future where everything's built on blockchain uh in financial services. So that's the
world that we're kind of playing for and infrastructure will

be really great investments in that world, but I think crypto will be good investment
as well. Exciting times. Eric Peters, thank you so much. Last time we had you
on, I think Bitcoin was 22K. ETH was about 1. 5K. So we've come a
long way since then. Hopefully we'll see a similar price appreciation the next time we
chat, too. Uh well, keep up keep up the good work. I I I love
the uh the content that you guys produce and and uh your your thoughtful questions
and your engagement in the space is is is really

wonderful. So, thanks and it's fantastic. You're doing a ton of education to people who
wouldn't listen to Banklist listen to Eric Peters. So, you're doing God's work there on
the back end. So, got to let you know, of course, Bankless Nation, crypto is
risky. You could lose what you put in, but we're headed west. This is the
frontier. Not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks
a lot. [Music] [Music].
