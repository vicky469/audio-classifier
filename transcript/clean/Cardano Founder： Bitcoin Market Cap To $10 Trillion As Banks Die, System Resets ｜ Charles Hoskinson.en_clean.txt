I think over the next 5 years, Bitcoin is going to 10 trillion. Um, I
think before the end of this bull market, Bitcoin will hit 250,000. I think Swift
is going to die. Uh, and these other large systems are going to die. They
just can't sustain themselves. It es and flows, but remember, cryptocurrencies is going to eat
AI and cryptocurrency is going to eat medical records, and there's all these non-financial use
cases that Bitcoin never will have an opinion on and never do. And so, it's
kind of silly thing to say, oh, well, all these

other guys will die. this online thing came out and the people who realized that
that's a big deal, they survived. And then the people who didn't realize that was
a big deal, they're all dead. And so banks are exactly the same. I'm very
pleased to welcome to the show Charles Hoskinson. He's a co-founder of Ethereum and uh
one of the most prominent uh smart contract blockchain originators. He's also developed uh Cardano
uh which we'll talk about in extensive detail. He's currently the CEO and founder of
Input Output, the company behind the Cardano blockchain, which is

now a top 10 cryptocurrency by market cap. We'll be talking about his views on
not just Cardano, but overall what the uh crypto ecosystem has in store for investors
in 2025 and beyond, and his outlook on Bitcoin, which we'll get into later on
in the interview. Importantly, I've pled a lot of people online on Twitter and Reddit
and in my own community, many Cardano and Ethereum holders alike, what they would like
to ask the founder of Cardano. And so I'll be going over a lot of
user questions and viewer feedback in uh this interview. So

comment below if you like to see any questions addressed uh in a potential follow-up.
So thank you very much, Charles, for being on the show. A great honor to
host you today. Thank you for being here. >> Thank you so much for having
me on, David, and congratulations on all your success. success. >> Oh, well thank you.
Uh it's because of really good guests like you that we've had a good program.
So appreciate you being here. Um I want to start by talking about Big Picture.
This is from uh a user by the name of

Fetto Blind on Reddit. I mean, this is a question that a lot of people
asked. I'm just using one example. What's his take on um why BTC is no
longer envisioned to be peer-to-peer money rather than a store of value. We'll start there
and then we can talk more about your history and Cardano. Cardano. >> I mean,
that's a very old school debate. I've been in the space such a long time.
I remember the origins of that. It was Bitcoin Cash versus Bitcoin. Um and in
the beginning, Bitcoin had to be everything. It had to

be a domain name register. It had to be an asset ledger to issue assets
on. So we had color coins and namecoin. Um, you know, it had to be
peer-to-peer money. It had to be a store of value. And the challenge is that
Bitcoin to be everything to everybody would have to upgrade itself to something like Ethereum.
It' have to be a general purpose smart contract ledger. Uh, and that philosophical debate
was discussed years ago. really it was the big block debate because the very first
step was expanding the space you can do things in

and then upgrading the programming languages and the accounting model to facilitate that. Uh the
big blockers lost and what that meant was that Bitcoin basically became kind of a
store value system which is perfectly fine because it's digital gold and the value of
gold is $10 trillion and the value of Bitcoin is approaching 10 trillion and it'll
get there in 5 10 years. uh so it it can live in that space
but uh it that means it has to be augmented. So the compromise was first
Segwit and later on Taproot and the idea is that

you create a space on Bitcoin where Bitcoin can talk to other systems whether it
be layer 2s or layer 1's and those other systems can backfill those things that
you want Bitcoin to be whether it be a smart contract system or you know
some sort of data storage system or an NFT ledger or whatever the heck it
is you can do it over there. And the second part of that is allowing
you to pay your transaction fees in Bitcoin and get your yield back in Bitcoin.
And so as long as you can do that, Bitcoin

feels like it has all these capabilities. Even though the base protocol is tremendously simple,
that's just the way history worked out. Uh Roger and Mike Hearn and others were
on the other side of it. I uh straddled both sides. I actually held a
lot of Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin and you know, the space evolved in that direction
and it created space for projects like Ethereum and Cardano to kind of become very
large and and prominent. >> Okay. uh you do have a uh Bitcoin thesis and
we'll talk about why you think it's going to grow

to uh trillions of market cap in just a minute. Um we'll talk about that
later in the interview. So stay tuned for um Charles's outlook on Bitcoin and Bitcoin's
ecosystem. But let's just take a step back and talk about Cardano. So you were,
as I mentioned in the introduction, one of the co-founders of Ethereum along with Vitalik
and Gavin Woods. Um why did you step back from Ethereum and ultimately found Cardano.
Well, I mean that's something that was 11 years ago and I was only there
for 6 months. There was eight founders and we all

had philosophical differences about what needed to be done to build something of the scale
and magnitude of Ethereum. And uh the majority of the founders are gone. There's eight
of them. One is left Vitalic. The other seven we a lot of us went
on and created our own blockchains. I created Cardano. Gavin Wood created Polka Dot. Uh
you got Joe Luben with Consensus. said, "Well, it's not a blockchain. It's certainly a
large ecosystem, mostly in the Ethereum ecosystem, but they they have other interests as well.
" Um, and that's fine. You know, people can have

philosophical disagreements. I I thought that it would be better to start from a Bitcoin
oriented view and extend and enhance it based upon ideas that had come from the
Bitcoin space than try to build a completely different paradigm from scratch. uh because Bitcoin
had already thought around a lot of things like how do you do accounting right
with UTXO and how do you issue assets and how do you gradually improve your
programmability inside the system. If you go in the other direction, then you'll end up
having a situation where you do too much and you

introduce a lot of security problems and then you have to go back to the
drawing board and back to the drawing board and uh and actually ironically Vitalik and
I were both right the success of Cardano and the success of Ethereum and the
emergence of Bitcoin DeFi what we've seen is that actually the space can admit both
paradigms and it's taken about 10 years to run that experiment. We've both learned a
huge amount over that those 10 years and um there's a there's a ton of
great software and specialized hardware on both sides to kind

of facilitate these ecosystems and get them where they need to be. Um but you
know Cardano is kind of the counterfactual. People often ask like what would have happened
had I stayed at Ethereum. the road map would have looked a lot more like
what Cardano Sans uh some ideas from Polka Dot and some ideas from Vitalic and
uh maybe it would have worked out better as a hybrid system but maybe the
Ethereum approach was the best approach it's hard to argue with their commercial success and
it's hard to argue with the adoption but you know

on the other hand there's been a lot of missteps as well so you know
take it take it with a grain of salt before we continue I want to

to get started. I will get to Cardano specific questions in just a bit. But
on that note about how Ethereum would have evolved into Cardano, um what is your
view on how Ethereum evolved over time. Specifically, what was your view on the merge
2022 switching from proof of work to proof of stake. >> Well, you know, it's
kind of funny. We always thought that their proof ofstake pro protocol would have been
written by Ela Shei. You know, we we were competitors

with that group. So we we created Ora Boris and she created Snow White and
we were neck andneck and we watched the research that they were doing like fruit
chains and sleepy and these other things and we said well oh that's that's quite
obviously what Ethereum is going to do for its proof ofstake protocol um and we
knew that u Ming who was the executive director at the time was friends with
Elaine um and so they had the relationships they had the access and they had
first mover advantage and so we thought that they would

adopted um Snow White and hardforked somewhere around you know 2017 2018 2018 uh to
uh to proof of stake. They chose a very weird path. They did this whole
Casper thing and kind of meandered for a bit and eventually they got to the
merge and got it done. The big challenge with the merge is that it's a
under the hood kind of sort of custodial non-lquid system. Now they've had to do
all this stuff to make it liquid non-custodial and they've created assets like Lido and
you know they have this weird slashing and bonding. But

the biggest philosophical difference has always been you don't need to slash and bond to
create a secure network. Cardano has been running for 8 years 24/7. Uh since uh
2020 we've been running with proof of stake full true oraorous proof of stake. We've
never had an issue and there's no bonding or slashing and you the assets are
liquid. So I think this is the biggest philosophical difference this idea that they have
to go out of the way to create a lot of economic security inside the
system. Um, and that was kind of the reason why

they put so much extra infrastructure into Ethereum and they're now following that. Now, under
the hood, there's a lot of great things to like. Um, fast FAL is pretty
good. They have a pretty good idea of how to make things faster. They've done
some great work on the network protocol side uh to kind of facilitate their plans
and they've kind of kept up with things like the the Dank sharding upgrade and
these things because they their problem is that they have a large L2 ecosystem. And
so when you think about Ethereum, you're never thinking about

Ethereum in isolation. You're thinking about Ethereum in Ethereum on off-chain, Ethereum on like L2s,
Ethereum on other networks. And there's there's all these things that are happening. So you
have to put a lot more thought into your network stack to how you do
pub sub, how you do event brokering, and these other things. They've been able to
keep up with it. And actually, I think the design they have now is is
pretty sensible, and they're going all in on ZK. If you take a look at,
you know, the next 5 10 years, the biggest advancements

are no longer raw TPS or consensus or network upgrades. It's all zero knowledge and
uh and they're betting heavy on hashes and they they want to get to these
gigas, you know, threshold and uh the only way you're going to get there is
with recursion and folding schemes and they're they're betting big with ZKVMs. Uh so that's
probably a very sensible road map and and things like Casper become less relevant. You
know, we were talking about high performance BFT protocols and high performance consensus protocols back
in like 2020, 2021, 2022 and everybody had something like

we did narwhal and tusk, you know, and we have or leos and you know,
Ethereum was looking at like sharding ether. This was the Ethereum 2 road map, but
that all fell out of favor for ZK. And now most people are now talking
about ZK's either as rollups recursion or folding and that's their road map. Now >>
you mentioned slash and bond. What does that mean for the audience. >> So, slashing
and bonding basically means that if if you behave badly, you have some ether that
you've locked and you lose it or you lose access

to it for a while. It there's many different ways you can do these schemes
and one could be a temporary loss or a permanent loss and it could be
destroyed or could be reallocated to other people. And basically the idea is it creates
an economic incentive for you to be an ICE actor. Um otherwise you have nothing
at stake. So in proof of stake, you want to resolve long range attacks and
nothing at stake attacks where if you have nothing at stake and nothing to lose,
you have no incentive not to behave badly. And long-range

attacks means it's quite easy to reorganize the um the chain. Um so we did
a lot of work using uh some creative timekeeping and cryptography to show that you
don't need to do that because the downside of bonding uh and slashing and staking
this way is that your money gets tied up. And so the only option you
have is to create some synthetic asset that's it's like I can't believe it's not
butter. I can't believe it's not ether, you know. And so you create a synthetic
asset and then you trade that you get your liquidity

back. But at the end of the day, your stuff is still locked. And so
if you you you have to lock it's really hard to get more than a,
you know, 10 20% of your supply involved in consensus because people want liquidity. In
some cases by law they have to have liquidity like if they're custodial accounts or
things like that. Um, so when you have a liquid non-custodial system where you can
stake without locking your stuff, then pretty much anybody can participate, which is why over
70% of the ADA supply is staked right now, but

it doesn't get counted as TVL by DeFi Lama or other people because it doesn't
get locked. Uh, so it's very liquid and you can move it at any time.
>> Okay, let's move on to uh the current macro environment for crypto. This is
from uh Treasury Secretary Scott Pent uh on the announcement of the Genius Act dated
July 18th. So last month, he said, "Stable coins represent a revolution in digital finance.
The dollar has now an internet native payment rail that is fast, frictionless, and free
of middlemen. This groundbreaking technology will buttress the dollar status

as the global reserve currency, expand access to the dollar economy for billions across the
globe, and lead to a surge in demand for US treasuries, which back stable coins.
" Well, uh, first of all, I'd like to respond to that statement. And the
followup to that is from a user. Given the federal governments are going to be
using stable coins to keep the US dollar as the global currency, as I just
referenced, what part does Cardano play in this big shift. So, uh, I was just
at a round table with the Federal Reserve and it

was a really nice inner industry. Uh, so two of the reserve governors were there.
Um and uh I was actually with Anatoli from Salana and Sergey from chain link
and uh Ilia from near and uh Brad from XRP. So it was a very
nice uh round table and we had a chance to directly interact with the Federal
Reserve and the Fed is trying to figure out you know what is their role,
place and purpose with the genius act because traditionally the Fed is the payment regulator
and they've been doing that for 120 years give or

take. Um the the thing about the Fed uh is that they were kind of
left out of the party. There's three primary regulatory bodies that deal with this. There's
the OC, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve. The reason this is relevant is that
stable coins live in two worlds at the same time. One, they live in the
web 3 world. So they they're tokenized. And we think a lot about, well, how
do I get more liquidity and volume. There's over $250 billion worth of tokens that
have been issued, 180 plus million transactions every month. It's

a very dense, beautiful, high velocity space. But those only have value because somebody's holding
an asset on the other side in the legacy world. And the legacy world, it's
either at a bank or it's somewhere else and it's represented some way like as
a treasury for example. So genius, what it did is it created some baseline rules
of the road. But now rulemaking has to occur and they have to start talking
about things like can you get a master account with the Fed or how do
you ensure these or what are the custodial standards or

what is the audit oversight and how do you audit these accounts and also the
grading and scoring of these things. So are all stable coins created equally or is
there some delta between the asset allocations between tether and circle for example where tether
has admitted to have commercial paper cuz while they may appear to be a dollar
they may be very different the other thing is also you'd like to augment these
things a little bit for example can you offer yield with the stable coin so
genius was very clear about this there was a big

fight and the non-yield people won and they said you can't offer yield with the
genius act. Uh that said, there's a lot of people that are starting to take
a step back and say, "Well, hang on a second. Well, maybe there's some clever
mechanisms where we kind of create a dual token and it's for non- US customers,
they can share in the yield, the stable coin or something, and US customers just
get the stable coin. " And now we're starting to see blended versions like Tether
is going to move into the United States with some

of their stable coin and some not. But what's the point. Well, the point is
soft dollarization. And there's no greater example of this than Argentina. There's $700 billion economy
and a hundred billion dollars of that economy is in cryptocurrencies with the majority being
in stable coins. So basically this is a place where technically the currency is the
peso but what's happening is the they're dollarizing and they're trading the Argentine central bank
for the Federal Reserve and without the consent of the US government it's just through
the hand of the free market and people are basically

transacting in dollars now through stable coins and you're going to see a lot of
that happen in Colombia and Venezuela and all throughout Africa and Southeast Asia and so
that soft dollarization is at war with the off yuanization of the world because a
belt road the Chinese government is trying to push a concept of a digital yuan
and these things are fighting in developing nations and uh and uh you know places
that are a little bit off the beaten path and that's really exciting because it
means you can now have a direct financial relationship with

those consumers in those markets. So if you're Microsoft and you're dealing with Sri Lanka,
you don't have to go through 14 hops and three forex conversions and other things
to get to the local money and deal with the local person in the local
bank. They can just simply pay you in a dollar back stable coin. You have
peer-to-p peer relationship and it's feeless or near free for fees. The velocity of global
commerce then is going to increase. So what this means is you're going to see
a huge expansion of the category overall. So you're going

to grow from hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars of stable coins issued and
you're going to see a localization of stable coins. We're going to have flavors that
are regionalized either a subbrands that are a big brand like Tether is doing with
USD or uh there just regionalization stuff and uh great markets that provide liquidity here
and there. Now, this only works if there's great regulation, there's great auditability, cuz the
minute that a stable coin fails, it creates catastrophic consequences to the faith and credibility
of the system as a whole. So, the hope of

genius was to begin the regulatory conversation. Uh, but by no means is it done.
And to be frank, the Fed does need to be brought in a little bit,
if anything, just because of their traditional role in payments. And they've been left out
because of CBDC concerns. So, they kind of have to work it out. And it's
a very difficult situation. We in industry, we're already talking about it. And one of
the things we talked about in the round table is this idea of algorithmic regulation.
So you can actually have smart contracts and they are

public private partnerships and they handle things like freeze and sees and KYC and AML
and other compliance concerns and they allow for liquidity across nations and cross networks but
some modicum of control in the secondary market. Uh so it's a challenging very deep
situation but it's one of the fastest areas of growth and it's also going to
get complicated by uh the fact that large companies like Google and Microsoft and Apple
have very strong incentives to come in because they lose tens of billions of dollars
every year to transaction fees and banking costs and forex

fees and they have customers in pretty much every country and three billion people. So
they would much rather cut out middlemen and they already have the payment rails in
many cases the licenses to do this. Um, and then it's also complicated complicated by
the legacy banks now wanting to come in like JP Morgan's going to come in
and others are going to come in and they have a lot of blockchain infrastructure
waiting to do this. They just have been waiting for a regulation to give them
the ability to do so. And now that genius is

there, there's rules of the road for them to begin the process. But it's going
to take several years of rulemaking for all of this to get completely sorted out.
And there's still a lot of open questions and everybody's just trying to figure out
how to put the pieces together. I wonder what's going to happen to the future
of custody and um custodial services with the expansion of stable coins and adoption of
stable coins. Do you see the government issuing in in America. I'm talking about the
government of the US issuing something like uh what El

Salvador did uh for their citizens, which is a governmentbacked wallet. Um you know, ultimately
what is what are people going to use for holding their stable coins. >> Nice
if the Fed could just directly issue treasuries onto a blockchain. The minute you do
that, then it solves tons of custodial problems because then you can hold the treasuries
as a reserve for the uh for the stable coins and the stable coins could
then trade. uh but it gets a little too close for comfort for CBDC's but
there's got to be some way with the real world

asset side of the house because one of the things that's missing and hopefully we
can start the process of getting it in with clarity is we have to have
a conversation of how do we handle tokenized securities in general in our industry and
allow them to trade like cryptocurrencies one of the reasons why nobody wanted to be
securities in the cryptocurrency space is many of your security lose all liquidity can't trade
on Coinbase can't trade on Binance and so you are at a massive structural liquidity
disadvantage over all the commodity elements that are trading on

the exchanges. So, a lot of people got deeply concerned and they said, well, you
know, we can't we can't go down there. Above and beyond the fact that compliance
is impossible because you don't have as an issuer usually the uh necessary information to
file a disclosure because you just don't know what's going on in the network. You
couldn't if it's truly decentralized. So, but there's got to be a way to kind
of figure out how to bridge that gap and create a tokenized security and then
that solves starting a lot of these problems about stable

coins and liquidity because it starts taking treasuries out of the and dollars out of
the local banking system and it puts them completely into the cryptocurrency system. And if
they're in the cryptocurrency system, I can do proof of reserves because they're on a
blockchain and you can see that. So your custodial risk completely goes away and you
can start treating stable coins like real dollars because they're backed by functionally debt of
the US government which is what the US dollar is backed by and you can
even add privacy to it if you want to. So

in lie of that uh which I'd say is probably about five years out to
seven years out at the current progress we have because you have to pass clarity
you have to do the rule making it'll take two to three years minimum for
rule making for clarity and for uh for a genius cuz many of your listeners
might not know this but when you pass a law that's not the end it's
the beginning the law has in it like this agency shall this agency shall and
so what they have to do is get together and

say what is our interpretation of the law and then they issue guidelines to the
regulated actors Well, fundamentally, how is >> how how is what you're proposing now different
than a CBDC, which Trump said he will not do. >> Well, it's not because
it's just debt issued on chain. A CBDC is your nation's currency and they have
monopoly over it. So, they say, "We're going to put a dollar on chain. It's
our dollar that we've issued. It's backed by the face and goodwill of the United
States. It's not a debt instrument. It's like when you

hold a dollar, you can't go and get it for something else. " When when
they issue a treasury, they're saying that's a that's a security. You buy it just
like you would anything else. and actually uh you know it has an obligation for
them to pay you a coupon in in dollars. So so you get the government
out of the minting business and you just get them into the security business and
they let the industry do the minting side and the minting side can be under
any privacy regime. The big concern that people have with

CBDC's is everything you buy is tracked anytime your money can be frozen and in
any time you can be targeted for political reasons or otherwise. If you just issue
assets and they're an open market and anybody holds them and you hold them like
you would a security and then you can put them in smart contracts to create
another asset, all of those things are going to be under various different regimes and
in fact many cases lighter touch regulation than the current system because the current system
you have banking regulation which is the heaviest regulation possible

on the legacy side and they have some sort of cryptocurrency thing but because you
have to bridge them they require you to put freeze and season and KYC stuff
and all these other things. And it gets pretty messy when you actually start looking
at it. And what'll end up happening is it's already occurred. Law enforcement will just
start pulling that and they kind of can unwind the tape and know everything you've
ever done since the beginning. And they can do it with much less constitutional protections
than they could if it was done with algorithms. Uh

cuz you can you can many cases not have those requirements. So it takes time
you know and we're we're trying to sort all this out and as I said
rulem is there but remember treasuries are just one class of security at the end
of the day there's many uh fixed income securities that you can put on there's
all kinds of uh complex uh derivatives or there things that you can put in
and we already kind of sort of have those with the DeFi space they're just
not called that but they are and and so we

need to rewrite those rules a bit and and acknowledge that you can have a
decentralized security and you can use the blockchain as the mechanism for settlement, clearing and
disclosure. As long as that's the case, you can get rid of the broker dealer
and you can go from T2 to T0 and you can actually have a proper
end to end uh global market for this stuff and then you get rid of
traditional stock exchanges and kind of move the dexes and then what the government will
do is just say well regulations smart contracts and so

if you want to be compliant with our particular regime or for these particular assets
then you have to use this smart contract to and settlement is compliance. So when
I send you it, the transaction doesn't clear if I can't comply with the regulatory
regime of that asset. that asset. >> Sorry, what what do you mean. Back up
a minute. What do you mean. Uh traditional stock markets will change. Uh what what
does the future look like exactly. >> There's no reason to have centralized exchanges. I
just think about how preposterous it is. It's like there's

it's the ultimate trust me bro situation. And they're like, "We're all just going to
give our money to this guy over there and then we're then we're going to
trade like imaginary tokens that are that aren't that money against each other and just
hope that that guy is going to settle us up after it's all said and
done. We're also going to hope that that guy's not going to peek at the
ledger and trade against us and manipulate the market and give us fake data feeds
and other things like that. " So, so it's trust

me bros is that's why Dexes are so nice because the blockchain is the bro.
And so there you you you have an honest ledger. You have an honest order
book. And you kind of know where the the uh you know the attack vectors
are. And it's a sec it's a cryptography problem not a regulation problem. So why
exchanges are among the most regulated actors by design because you have a custodial risk,
you have order book risk, you have front running, you have so many different things
that can happen there. Um so regulation tends to follow

what can go wrong. So, the sooner we can get those types of structures into
dexes and get those dexes to be upgraded a little bit, uh, the better for
everybody because then you don't have custody risk. You don't have order book issues or
any of these types of things. The other thing is that exchanges have enormous amounts
of power right now in the in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. So, when you're a new
project, project, project, >> in many cases, exchanges will charge you millions to tens of
millions of dollars to list. When you're a debt, you

don't pay anything. People just trade it and you create a market for it. So
that's very predatory because you end up having a situation where the supposedly objective people
who are supposed to be neutral are now picking winners and losers based upon who's
paying them large sums of money to list. That's not a situation we want to
be in as an industry. So Dex is the more we can do as an
industry to move in that particular direction, get people comfortable with it, the the better
for everybody because then you remove that tendency to create

issues. Could you could you imagine if only like three people could ever give you
a bank account and they go and say, "Well, I'm sorry. You have to pay
me a million dollars to get a bank account and the bank account's the only
way you can make payroll or any of these types of things. " That's literally
where we're at as an industry. There's only a handful of these powerful exchanges and
they control all liquidity. I I I've talked to several DEX founders um uh during
my interviews and the consensus is that yes, in the

future there will be a less reliance on banks. There will become redundant financial institutions.
But if everyone starts using Dexes for example, just hypothetically, won't they become the next
bank. I mean, won't there be calls for governance to be around Dexes and more
standardized protocols and more uh standardized um uh uh regulations that will basically force them
into the pathway of becoming the next bank. >> Yeah. But the problem is that
the medium is too permissive and porous and um also many of the regulations were
designed to resolve things that blockchains don't suffer from. you

don't have custodial risk, you don't have transparency issues, you don't have disclosure issues cuz
blockchain does all that for free. And you move to intrinsically a T0 and you're
also dealing with the actual asset as opposed to dealing with a synthetic asset. So
when I trade Bitcoin on Coinbase and trade it for ADA on Coinbase, I'm not
trading Bitcoin and ADA. I'm trading their version of it and the person who receives
my Bitcoin is hoping that they will be able to withdraw the real the real
thing at some point. But there's no guarantee of that

outside of the regulation, faith, and goodwill of those actors. Now, I know the Coinbase
people, they're very good people, and they're tightly regulated people. So, they're probably going to
do it right. But the challenge is that we've had hundreds of exchange failures and
um you give too much power to these people. So, Dex is you don't have
any of those risks. You're trading the actual assets. And the the payment system is
the blockchain. The disclosure system is the blockchain, the record keeper is the blockchain. And
you can even have dark pools if you want and

you can use that with privacy enhancing systems as uh smart contracts. So you can
keep things private but you still get uh disclosure in that uh it you know
that things were done fairly cuz the chain ordered it. So it's just an intrinsically
superior paradigm. The other thing is is is is the market wants to be liquid
and they want 24/7 global liquidity. When you do exchanges, you're intrinsically geotagged. you're stuck
in America or you're stuck in Japan and it's hard to get foreign customers because
what you end up having to do is for every

country you trade with you have to build basically a mini bank in each of
those countries and comply with an enormous amount of regulation. Dexes don't care. So even
if people try to regulate them because the markets are open and this technology is
open, it's much much more difficult to uh to uh install a draconian regulatory regime
to that. And what'll happen instead is you move to algorithmic regulation. So you use
smart contracts and use proofs on the wire and DIDs and these types of things
and settlement is compliant. So you so it'll you can't

deposit in the DEX unless you've you've selectively disclosed something to some relevant party that's
in your geography, but it'll be different for each user based upon the origin of
funds uh that come through. But the minute you're in the deck, you swap, then
when you withdraw, you withdraw and nobody can stop that inside the system. And this
is what we mentioned to the Federal Reserve and you know this is what we've
talked to a lot of different regulators about is you know how do we move
to algorithmic regulation and to enable T0 into massively uh

massively lower compliance costs. costs. >> So what is the future for traditional banks once
stable coin adoption becomes mainstream. mainstream. >> Well the banks that adopt the stable coins
will make a lot of money and the banks that don't um will go out
of business. You know it's just like new media. You know, if you create a
website and you have an you have a you a Twitter account and all these
other things, maybe the New York Times will do pretty good, but nobody's going to
read your paper paper anymore. You know, the old people

will, but the young people move over. So, you have to stay up with the
technology. And the problem with banking is they got good gig. You know, they kind
of created a monopoly for themselves. They kind of regulated into a wall and they
have a model and a way of doing things. And just like news media had
a model and a way of doing things. They had subscriptions. It's the best thing
in the world. like Pearson would a little, you know, 12-year-old ride his bike and
throw a paper at your door at 5:00 in the

morning and you'd go and pick up your paper at 6:00 a. m. with your
coffee and read it. That was their business model and it worked really well. And
then suddenly this online thing came out and the people who realized that that's a
big deal, they survived. Um there has to be interoperability and there's emerging payment protocols
like X. 42 402 Coinbase created um with Google, you have um you know modifications
the open banking standards uh that have been proposed and pushed but ultimately the the
the interoperability is going to have to be there and

I and I think Swift is going to die uh and these other large systems
are going to die. There's too many downsides. There's too much legacy complexity and at
the end of the day there's an enormous amount of trust and lack of consumer
protection. If nobody believes me and the bankers are like, "Oh, well then go to
your bank and try to send a wire. " You notice how many times they
try to talk you out of sending a wire and how many disclosure forms you
have to file. Well, there's wire fraud. Have you checked

your account. account. >> Terrible system. >> Exactly. So, so let me let me get
this straight. I I can use like multi-IG and ledger devices and all these things
to have tons of security and it's super easy for any consumer to do that.
Well, you could be a multi-billion dollar financial institution and and you have to put
in all these bells and whistles and even still you have some guy call you
after you've sent a wire saying, "Did you really send that wire. You know, I
need to know everything about the transaction to verify that's

a wire or else we're going to put a freeze on it. " That's just
a broken system and it can't survive when its competitor is used just, you know,
tap your phone with trusted hardware in your Google phone or your iPhone and you
just use your fingerprint. We know it's you. Well, people are concerned about privacy on
stable coins and here's a question from a user on X stake with pride is
a username. How can the Cardano partner chain Midnight I add privacy to stable coins.
coins. >> So what Midnight does is it gives you

computational privacy back. We call it rational privacy. So you take two things together. You
take a smart contract system and the smart contract system then you combine it with
an identity system and you embed within your private smart contracts DIDs and then you
create what's called a selective disclosure regime. So you basically say, who gets to know
my business. Maybe it's just me. That's what Monero and Zcash do. It's just me.
It's disclosure of one. Or maybe it's my brother and I, or maybe it's my
brother and my mom and dad and I, or you

know, maybe it's my business. Uh, like maybe it's my HR department. Whoever you disclose
with, that's the person who gets a transparent transaction. And then it's private for everyone
else. Once you have those primitives in play, you can reconstruct any financial asset into
that paradigm. You can deploy a private stable point. You can deploy a private security.
You can do private trading on a DEX. And uh it's public to those you're
disclosing to and it's private otherwise. So here's a great uh hallucinating example to make
it real. So all the time people track uh addresses

for exchanges for when people deposit withdraw money from exchanges and they kind of get
a sense of inventories and other things. Well, what if you could withdraw and deposit
to an exchange anonymously. He said, "Oh, Charles, you can't do that. But what about
the travel rule. They have to comply with the travel rule. Well, what if you
have selective disclosure for travel rule compliance to the requisite agencies, but everybody else that's
private. Then nobody can ever see the things going in and out of Binance or
in and out of Coinbase as an example and track

those things. This is very valuable thing. Well, that's what Midnight seeks to do is
that we've built a whole stack of technology um and we created a smart contract
system called Kacina. We built it into a privacy stack called Plonc and uh in
Halo 2. So Plunk is the arithmetization and Halo 2's proving system and it basically
gives us fully programmable private smart contracts. And we wrote a beautiful programming language called
compact which is based on Typescript. And Compact basically gives you the ability to write
JavaScript like code to build private smart contracts. And you

embed within them your disclosure requirements. And if you have none, it's a private fully
private. If you have some, it's to whoever you decide in the smart smart contract
design. This allows you then to capture regulated business and start thinking about what a
real world asset would look like in a highly regulated regime, but have the liquidity
and appearance of a cryptocurrency asset. And this also allows you to add privacy to
other assets like Bitcoin or Ether because what Midnight does is it has bridges uh
to seven ecosystems, Bitcoin all the way to B&amp;B and

beyond. uh Ethereum, Salana, Cardano, XRP, and you can basically send your assets into that
ledger and use them as fuel to power the smart contracts of Midnight. So, Midnight
doesn't have to use its underlying token, Dust, uh to power things. You can use
Bitcoin or Ether, other things. So, that means it's an extension of your infrastructure. We
kind of built it for hybrid applications. We have a public side and a private
side. So if you want to upgrade your decks to trade securities, you could build
a regulated DEX that's private on Midnight as an extension

of Uniswap. So you have regular stuff going on in Ethereum and then you have
the private stuff going on in in Midnight. And multi-chain signatures give you the ability
to just, you know, sort the whole thing out. So there's just a lot of
stuff there that we we we we tried to think around and we thought that
was the only way to expand cryptocurrency because the thing is like we got stuck
in this trap of of of like a winner takes all and uh and network
effect and uh you know fastness like my protocols a

little faster than your protocol you know like SW a little faster than Aptos and
Apto a little faster than Salana and that's really not where growth is going to
occur. it's going to occur. Who's going to create the bridges between the legacy world
and the web 3 world to allow the legacy world to begin moving into the
web 3 world in a safe and effective way. And they have invariance that they
can't change. They can't change bank secrecy act. They can't change GDPR requirements. They can't
change broker dealer regulations. Maybe they can over a 5

or 10 year period through massive amounts of lobbying and industry participation, but they can't
change it today. So you need something where they can program those things in and
have an algorithmic representation of them and then they can then use that to touch
Ethereum and touch Bitcoin and touch Cardano. And by the way, for non-financial use cases
as well, there's HIPPA for health records. How would you build a system to broker
the movement of health records between different things. I can't have a blockchain based system
where you know that John Smith is going to the

urologist for his gorrhea. I can't go do that. That's not exactly like uh you
know something somebody would sign up for. So probably needs to be private. But on
the other hand, it needs to be immutable and timestamped because John Smith needs to
know that unauthorized people can't have access to his accounts and he needs absolute certainty
that uh that uh his accounts have not been tampered with and people have changed
things inside the council. Maybe somebody changes that paternity test and Mory Povich comes out
and says you are the father. you know, you you

probably really want some guarantees that if you take a paternity test that it is
what you say it is. So, you need immutability and you need timestamping. You need
auditability inside that system, but you need privacy at the same time. And so, Midnight
also covers those non-financial use cases which are so valuable for supply chains, medical records,
uh land registration, as well as the financial use cases like private stable coins and
these types of things. things. >> Is AI going to bypass some of this though.
I'm just pointing out a real life example. YouTube is

now launching AI age verification in the US which will automatically detect users over 18
regardless of what you've inputed manually. So I mean I don't >> they say that
and how are they doing it. They're doing it with very sophisticated cookie schemes and
browser fingerprinting and probabilistic models but the real way that you get true verification is
through an oncreds and dits. And so you can use AI to probabilistically understand things
and where and when that makes sense that's fine. But it's not an access control
system. And so uh DIDs what they do for you

is they give you the ability to definitively prove you are somebody to somebody who
cares. And then with zero knowledge technology you can prove it to the rest of
the world and they as long as they trust that group of people the root
of trust then you know that you're dealing with a real person. As an example
let's say you had the passport system. Well, if we have passports as dids, then
you have a zero knowledge system. You can prove you're a US citizen, but you
don't have to show your passport to do that. You

can prove you're a credit investor, but you don't have to show how much money
you have. So, it's a much more general thing. But age verification is certainly an
attribute we all care about. And uh the porn industry is desperate for this because
they're having to blacklist entire states like Texas and Utah and others because of these
age verification requirements. And they're looking for some technology to do that. And so I
think this is this is awesome because also it changes compliance from a game of
being like a data warehouse packrat where you have to

store giant amounts of information and you know in your basement hope to God that
you don't need it and file suspicious activity reports to gave it 21 questions. Can
I do business with David. All right. Well, here are my questions. Question A, yes,
no. Question B, yes, no. Question C. And you go down and after 5 10
15 questions, either you get to yes, I can do business with him or no.
That's what I mean when settlement is compliance because as part of the clearing function
you'll run that game zero knowledge proofs will be generated.

It'll collect those proofs as a chain of evidence and then once it passes those
proofs it either decides to settle or not settle. So the other thing that's happening
at the same time is the intent revolution. So intents are partial transactions. partial transactions.
You tell us your intent. It's not send this thing in Ethereum this exact amount
of blah. It's more like I want to trade five bitcoin for USDC at best
available price. Now notice something. I didn't tell you the price. I didn't tell you
the settlement time. I didn't tell you the network. I

didn't tell you the mechanism of settlement. I just told you my intent. What I
want. This is where AI is very powerful. And there's uh great blockchains like Near
that are looking into this. And there's Anomia and others. But basically the idea is
like AI will figure it out or some automated system will figure it out and
build that transaction for you. So your intent is kind of like what you want
to do then somebody fills in all the cream filling and then processes the transaction
and maybe it was Cardano that was lucky and got

that transaction with one of our dexes or maybe it's Ethereum or maybe it's Salana
but we got that you know with this and so the the world is moving
to an intent world because that partial transaction for game of 21 questions is regulation.
I have an intent to do business with unis swap. here's the stuff I want
to do business with and then there's going to be a challenge response protocol saying
well to do business with us you have to answer these 14 questions with zero
knowledge proofs and if you can attach all those proofs

or somebody on your behalf can attach those proofs like your KYC organization like Acuant
or something like that then the transaction settles and then the transactions built as the
composite of all those things the value the cryptographic signatures but also the zero knowledge
proofs now on the other side what do I have I don't know who you
are. I don't have your personally identifiable information. I don't know anything about you. I
just have zero knowledge proofs. That's it. And I have some transaction data, but I'm
in full compliance because embedded within those proofs is some

way that a regulator could unravel uh you know the root data and verify that
those proofs are correct. Well, going back to Cardano development itself, some people in the
Cardano community are a little bit frustrated at what they perceive is slow pace of
development. And here's a question specifically from a user on X. His name is Jonathan
Strange. Why has Cardano focused so heavily on a researchbacked approach rather than the move
fast and break things approach. What were the downsides to this approach. And I guess
to add to that, the upsides, pros, >> well, >>

well, >> well, the this the irony is the research actually is pretty fast. It's
the engineering that got really slow. Um, so so we've published over 250 papers and
it probably take another 10 years to implement all those papers if we wanted to.
So we're really good at writing papers and going through the peerreview process. That's not
the limiting function. Like I'll give you a great example. We we we published Orworth
Genesis back in 2018 and we just rolled it out this year into Cardano. So
the the historical bottleneck was the engineering side and there

was a variety of legacy reasons for that. A no one had ever built these
types of systems before. So we were very conservative in the design and we chose
very specialized tools like Haskell uh to to do these types of things. But now
that we've built up, you know, large domain of experience and we've created a large
open source project, what Cardono has turned into is actually one of the fastest moving
in terms of development uh projects around. Uh and a great example would be that
while Ethereum took till 2022 to do the merge, we

actually did our proof of stake in 2020. So we we beat them by a
few years and uh we're speeding up in terms of our ability to interoperate with
other systems, launch other blockchains that are connected to Cardono like Midnight. Um, so we're
now a full AVS system as of next year. Uh, you we've added zero knowledge
support very rapidly and so every year we're just like getting major upgrades to the
system. It's just it took a while to get the foundations right. The other thing
is that was a lot of firsts. Like we were

the first liquid non-custodial staking system, but we were the first extended UTXO system to
add smart contracts to uh UTXO. you know in the in the Ergo was also
there, Nervos was there, but we were like the first at scale like $30 billion
and people actually doing real things. We were the first to implement color coins at
the base protocol level with the Cardono native token standard. Uh so because these things
were first, we actually had to figure out the development model and it took quite
a bit of time to build all those toolings because

it's not a onetoone match with Ethereum. You can't just go and deploy an EVM
smart contract on Ethereum on Cardano. You actually have to do it differently. Now the
advantage is that long-term we have enormous scalability potential with these things because we have
local determinism. What happens on your computer is the same thing that happens on the
global network. This is not the case with Ethereum or any other system. It's a
very rare property in distributed systems but we have that which means also we have
a much stronger layer 2 game. So when you start

getting to payment channels, state channels, roll-ups, these types of things, they work much much
better and faster on Cardono than they would on other systems. So these are trade-offs
and locally what it meant is we were slower out the gate for many things
and it hurt our DeFi ecosystem and a lot of adoption and interoperability. But longterm
once you get past those hurdles, you start having a takeoff velocity because you bet
on a the right paradigm long term. And what's cool is you see that with
Bitcoin DeFi where we fit with Bitcoin really beautifully almost

like two molecules and docking with a with you know like a like a receptor.
They're just clicking into each other. Um whereas it doesn't work very well with Ethereum
and Salana as examples because they are a different accounting model and they have a
different security model whereas we can clock together because of the design assumptions that we
made. Well, you know over the next 5 years where's the majority of DeFi growth
going to be. Is it going to be Ethereum continuing to 10x every year. Or
is it going to be all that dry Bitcoin that

institutions hold wanting a yield going in and creating yield. It doesn't take a meaningful
percentage of Bitcoin before you have more TVL than the market cap of Salana. You
know, that's Bitcoin DeFi. And it's easy to do because you only have to get
like seven or eight financial institutions to start deploying their Bitcoin uh because they now
they hold so much of it into the DeFi markets. and they're going to do
that where they can still preserve the security of uh Bitcoin and pay transactions in
Bitcoin. So, uh so you know, we'll see what happens

in the next 5 or 10 years and I and I'm very comfortable with the
bets we've taken and the velocity I think is exactly where it needs to be.
It's a good mixture of now moving fast but with a lot of rigor that's
behind it and it's also polyglot now. So, we have Rust and we have Go
and we have TypeScript and Haskell in the ecosystem. So, we have a lot of
that legacy stuff, but then we have now the mainstream stuff, but we figured out
how to do the mainstream stuff and not break the

system, if that makes sense. Uh, the same user, Jonathan Strange, had a question about
the um the philosophy behind the fixed supply. So, Cardano's tokconomics are similar to Bitcoin
with a fixed supply. What was the thought process for that. He said, on top
of well, of the top 10 crypto, when you don't count stable coins, BMP, coin,
and XRP, etc. , Bitcoin and Cardano are the only cap supply tokens. What was
the thought process behind this. I I mean I that's what I believed in. I
was I was a big fan of Ron Paul and

goldbacked money and the whole reason you have goldbacked money is you can't just turn
on your money printing press and print as much as you want whenever it's convenient.
I mean if you want a wild graph take a look at the US money
supply over the last 20 years it's like kind of flat kind of flat kind
of and then 2008 and then later you know with co goes way way up.
You're like holy what just happened and everybody's like why are homes so expensive. Why
are cars so expensive now. Why does it feel like

I'm getting poorer, but my my my paychecks are the same and my taxes aren't
going up, but yet I can't buy as much. Look at shopping carts in 1990
versus 2025 of what you could buy with $20. It's inflation destroys you. So, you
know, a fixed monetary policy is awesome because then it organically deflates over time. Um,
and you know that if you are going to be part of that ecosystem, nobody's
going to show up and debase your money and you want sound money. So, Bitcoin
taught us that. Cardono in many ways is a spiritual

successor to Bitcoin. You know, they are UTXO. We're extended UTXO. They had color coins.
We put them at the protocol level. We based our proof ofstake protocol on proof
of work when we when we uh were designing security properties called the GKL15 model.
So, we also wanted to inherit the monetary policy. Now, Vitalik was thinking much more
like computational fuel. Uh, and he was saying, oh, you know, like fuels like oil,
you can always go drill some more, you know, these types of things. And so,
it could be variable. You can have inflationary periods and

deflationary periods. The problem is then you introduce a really complicated thing. You start inviting
the conversation of monetary policy into your governance. And then you you start having like
hawks and doves. And there's some people saying, for the good of the ecosystem, why
don't we, you know, increase inflation. And you have other people say, "Well, for the
good of the ecosystem, we need to keep it constrained. " And then you're just
fighting every year about your monetary policy of of where to take it and what
to do with it. Whereas, when you're in a deflationary

monetary policy, you you can't have the fight. No one is walking around saying, "Let's
change the Bitcoin emission rate. No, there's no path in Bitcoin to make that happen
and have more than 21 million bitcoins. " And there's no path in Cardano to
change the monetary policy of Cardano. What you see is what you get. You can
optimize around that. So you could disappear for 20 years and come back and it's
the same ADA supply. ADA supply. >> Another way to look at it then, Charles,
if I if I may add, perhaps then you looked

at Cardano as money at the onset instead of something to build applications on because
you can point to the fact that developers are favoring Salana, Ethereum, so on and
so forth for building layer 2 over Bitcoin, right. Yeah. And the other thing is
you can always invent a fuel token and back it by sound money or use
it with sound money. It's a lot harder to take a fuel token and turn
it into sound money. Uh, and so you start directionally where you have safety and
security and you work your way to utility. And as

long as you have a community that's willing to wait that time, you don't lose
anything. If you go in the other direction, it's really really hard to conjure that.
Like I don't think, for example, Bitcoin would be Bitcoin and survived if they tinkered
with the monetary policy. If they said, you know, let's because not a lot of
people got in early and Satoshi got too many coins, let's do 30 million Bitcoin
instead of 21, let's change the mining emission rate or something. Bitcoin would have died
if that uh if that happened. Well, let's uh finally

segue into Bitcoin itself. Uh this is a user on X. Everybody literally asking questions
he has already answered or questions they know how he will answer. Ask him his
thoughts on Michael Sailor and I guess by extension the Bitcoin treasury companies that are
um becoming more mainstream right now. Well, anytime you can increase liquidity and get more
people into the cryptocurrency space, that's intrinsically a good thing to me as long as
it's done in a responsible way and it's done with good governance and good regulation
behind it. So, there's a world of difference between you

buying a Bitcoin and having it in a non-custodial wallet you control and buying a
Bitcoin as a regulated product uh through an exchange and there's some third party that's
holding that. Um, so I don't have anything against DATs or for DATs. I think
that they're a mechanism. Um, it's more of are there the appropriate controls in and
are these structured in a way where you're not creating a synthetic asset that's decoupling
from your act underlying asset. This was my biggest concern in El Salvador with Shivbo
wallet. So back in 2021, we actually traveled El Salvador.

I met with Boule and we spent some time there and we brought the coalition
together that ended up creating Shivbo, Alpha Point and these other people. But I I
bowed out. We decided not to take the deal. One of our biggest concerns was
that we didn't think that there were appropriate controls connecting the Shivbo Bitcoin to the
actual Bitcoin in custody and we wanted US regulated entities to audit that is you
trade Shivbo in a centralized sense. It's like trading those Coinbase dollars or those Coinbase
Bitcoin. It's like well that only works if you trust

people. So if you start engineering financial products where the share price is different than
the underlying asset that's a problem because the only value of that financial product is
the underlying asset and that delta between the two is a bubble and that can
create a problem. So, uh, you have to be careful of these types of things
and you have to be, uh, you have to make sure that you walk into
it with both eyes open and you only invest in in, uh, these structures when
you, you think that there's long-term viability, uh, behind them.

So, Michael's been phenomenally successful and he's created one of the greatest mcguffins of all
time to acquire Bitcoin. Um, I he's starting to approach Bitcoin levels of Satoshi. You
know, I I I was actually one of the largest uh small holders of Bitcoin
for a brief period of time way back in the day. People forget that when
we did the Cardano sale, um the Cardano uh raised in yen, but it was
converted to Bitcoin for uh for transparency. In fact, our audit reports just about come
out here and it's going to show the addresses, but

we had 108,000 Bitcoin that was raised for Cardano. So, after it was all converted.
So, so you know, it was at $250 and $700. uh but now today's prices
that'd be like $14 billion or something like that. It's an incredible sum of money.
So there is kind of a moral hazard when you have such a colossal amount
of an asset in one hand or one entity and you know a small perturbation
or issue can create a problem. So what you try to do when that occurs
is make sure that the level of scrutiny increases proportionally

with the overall holdings and uh the regulatory structures we have right now are not
really as good as they need to be to deal with that and unfortunately Bitcoin
has no recourse. U but you know what we've been there before uh people forget
Mount Gaus I remember Mount Gaus and we survived that and people forget Silk Road.
I remember Silk Road we survived that. Okay so we can afford a collapse of
a DAT. we can afford uh 100,000 Bitcoin being stolen or $200,000 Bitcoin being stolen.
Bitcoin is so resilient and strong. It's just um these

things aren't Bitcoin. They're synthetic representations of it that are traded on exchanges and they
don't have to be on par with it one to one. Uh so whenever that
occurs, be very careful if you don't lose the reins cuz that horse is going
to run away real fast and you're not going to catch it. It's a lot
faster than you. Would you be ever opposed to the idea of a Cardano treasury
company concept. concept. >> It's inevitable and actually it's much more significant meaningful because there's
also staking and governance rights with Cardano. You don't have

any of those rights with Bitcoin. So, uh you have a different set of problems.
So, you still have that issue of of losing the reins letting the horse run
away. But then also what is the governance policy of the debt. I'll only support
a DAT if a DAT has a means of decentralizing governance, meaning that the community
has some sort of say or control uh over the uh the tokens governance. That's
where I draw the line cuz I don't like the idea of one entity centralizing
10 20% of the supply and then participating in governance

and some unelected group of bankers has a perma vote on uh on where Cardono
goes. That would be very problematic, you know, for the system. So, I think they're
nice in that they they you know, because what's a 70-year-old grandma going to do
if she wants to be part of the ecosystem. Is she going to go install
a wallet on her her non-existent cell phone and, you know, figure out how public
key cryptography works and self custody and this stuff. It's like, no, you know, give
her assets where she can call her broker or something

and do that. So, I kind of understand the point of that in the demographic
you're dealing with, but we as an ecosystems have to deal with the moral hazards
of these types of of situations. Then there's some technological innovations and there's social innovations
that can be put through. So DATs and Cardano are inevitable. If I had to
predict, I'd say we'll start seeing them within 90 days to 180 days. Um and
uh there's going to be all kinds of flavors that come through and we'll see
debts probably from midnight as well. It's very profitable for

people to pursue these things. It's just you have to do them with the right
wisdom and foresight and if you do then they can be very beneficial to the
ecosystem. What's your view on companies adding layer twos on Bitcoin to add a yielding
staking feature to generate yield versus something that natively generates yield through staking. So, uh
that's like Babylon for example and David Chi is the inventor of that and he's
a very good friend of mine. He actually is part affiliated with our lab at
Stanford um the blockchain lab we have there and they've

done a phenomenal job. I it's called an AVS system, actively validated services. And the
whole point is that you create some asset or you have some asset that has
some real value behind it. And then you can repurpose that asset to basically provide
security to another system. And it solves the bootstrap problem because you all the time
want to launch something, but when you launch it, you're very fragile and everybody has
a strong incentive to try to break you. So if you can borrow security from
another network and put that security onto your network, uh

then uh then you have the best of both worlds. You get to do something
new and you have total control over that thing, but you have a high security
basis for that. And I'm old enough to remember the merge mining days of Bitcoin
where they they would merge, mine, and mine multiple blockchains at the same time with
proof of work. So uh what Babylon's doing or any of these as systems as
layer 2 to Bitcoin with Bitcoin staking is a very similar concept. they've just kind
of proof of staked it. Now we formalized that concept

with a paper called minotaur and that turned into um IGEN layer and then Midnight
uses Minotaur at its core to show what's called multi-resource consensus. So you can put
multiple consensus algorithms together because the problem with AVS is handoff. I want to use
Bitcoin to bootstrap my network and I'm prepared to pay the Bitcoin holders a fee
to do that. But I don't want to use Bitcoin forever. I want to launch
my network and have my own consensus. So, how do I hand off between a
borrowed consensus and an endogenous consensus. And Miniur has a

solution for that. It allows you to link proof of work and proof of stake
and other things together into one ledger and you can change the ratios between them.
You have a view on Bitcoin and we'll wrap up here. You have a view
on Bitcoin's uh price uh uh towards the end of uh 2027. uh what's ultimately
going to drive the price upward and adoption. >> Well, the DATs have brought retail,
sovereign wealth funds are buying Bitcoin. US government holds 212,000 Bitcoin. It's uh it's pretty
crazy when you see it. So, I think over the

next 5 years, Bitcoin is going to 10 trillion. Um I think before the end
of this bull market, Bitcoin will hit 250,000. That's kind of the the flag I've
put in the ground for the ceiling of it. And the big driver is going
to be Bitcoin DeFi. you know, minute you can get yield and do stuff with
your Bitcoin. Uh, it's kind of like I say there's the gold mine and then
there's the gold. Right now, the gold lives at the gold mine. Well, the gold
doesn't have to live at the gold mine. The Bitcoin

network is the gold mine. It makes gold. You can take your gold and put
in the jewelry shop and the jewelry shops Cardano or Ethereum or STAX or you
know these types of things. Well, the minute you can do that, uh, Bitcoin gets
a yield. Bitcoin gets a yield. It's a very attractive instrument because it's limited downside
relative to all these other experimental things and it has equivalent upside in many cases
to other tokens. So the networks that facilitate that are going to be do very
well because they're going to get a ton of TVL.

They're going to get a ton of transaction volume. And the thing is under the
hood, it creates consumption for their tokens because people are paying those transaction fees in
Bitcoin, but it's it's inevitably has to be consumed with ADA or near or whatever.
Uh so it's like tourism when you go to the Caribbean and you know you
swipe your credit card, you're paying in US dollars. They get the local money, but
that tourism benefits the local economy. So, Bitcoin is going on tour and it's going
to leave the high population, very wealthy country and they're

going to go to the Caribbean and Hawaii and all these other places and those
are different blockchains and they'll do cool things. They'll consume cool things and they go
back home after they're done. So, once you're done getting your yield on your Bitcoin,
you go back to Bitcoin and uh and you go back to your house. So,
uh that's what's going to be the key driver of getting Bitcoin over 10 trillion
because then structured financial products can offer yields there. they could be uh sliced and
diced by Wall Street to be very safe and scored

and rated and then people just by proportion start including it like they do gold
in their IAS and their 401ks and these types of things and so the rule
making will let you do it. The minute that clarity is passed and all the
rulemaking comes in, Bitcoin will be treated like any other financial asset from purposes of
investment and taxes and at that point um you'll see a massive flow of money
into it because it's a hard asset like gold is. Well, once Bitcoin reaches $10
trillion, is that the rising tide that lifts all boats.

In other words, are all other cryptos going to follow or can you see Bitcoin
dominance just continue to rise uh back to uh pre2021 levels. Here's a bit, you
know, it es and flows, but remember, cryptocurrencies is going to eat AI and cryptocurrency
is going to eat medical records and there's all these non-financial use cases that Bitcoin
never will have an opinion on and never do. It's like, okay, so where am
I going to go build my medical record system. And doesn't decentralization matter. I call
EPS, economic, political, and social. So, so, so I can't

do any political or social things. Like, how do I build a competitor to Facebook
and have a decentralized social network. I want to do this in Bitcoin. It's an
absurd thing. Uh, you know, so, so no, you're you're going to have other standards
and you're going to have an internet of blockchains. And I say this as an
OG of OGs and I was in it in the very early days of Bitcoin.
and I was the founding chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation's education committee. I mean, I
understand a lot about it and I love that community

and ecosystem and there's a lot of value they have, but they chose to be
sound money and the minute that they chose to do that and be a store
of value, they have to go win. And winning means Bitcoin has to flip gold
and then it'll become the premier store of value for the entire world. Winning doesn't
mean that Bitcoin is going to be a replacement for Meta or replacement for the
Google search engine or you know the private medical record system of the world or
the largest decentralized exchange in the world. That's not what

winning means. Winning means you flip gold and you are the premier digital asset to
hold. And so I think the world is quite compatible with Bitcoin achieving that. But
then all these other people doing these things and oh by the way Bitcoin forces
the blockchainification digitalization of things and becomes an alternative banking stack you know indirectly because
it everybody has to start wiring into it and once they're in they're into the
rest of the network as well which are far more capable and programmable. We have
um this adversarial nature in the blockchain space and there's

this maximalism and all these people float around and it's just so disheartening at times
because you know we I'm trying to do real things. I we published 250 papers.
We we every day wake up, write code, and we want to solve hard problems.
And if I find my network is 5% more decentralized, I'm 5% happier. If I
find out I have another million users, I'm a million users happier. You know, not
because token price goes up, because we are getting people into a world with integrity
and a world with principles and censorship resistance and transparency.

So, I'd like to believe that we're philosophically aligned with Bitcoin. So why should it
be sum zero where if Bitcoin is to achieve great heights that's only at the
expense of our growth especially when Bitcoin's playing a different game. Are they going to
change your block time from 10 minutes to sub-second blocks. Are they going to go
from proof of work to different consensus algorithm. Are they are they going to allow
you to write like super complex smart contracts easily and have lowcost settlement and these
types of thing. No, they're not going to do that.

Why should they if they want to be the premier storage of value for uh
for the world. Just like does gold have to wake up and pretend it's silver.
Does gold have to go into your gas tank and let you drive your car.
You know, gold can be gold. Sure. Okay, I'll end here. So, what are you
working on these days. You you mentioned you're, you know, currently researching a lot of
different things. Just give us some of the projects you're engaged in and uh what
you expect to accomplish in the next uh year or

two. What can we look forward to, Charles. Oh, huge huge inroads in interoperability with
a lot of different systems and we have some phenomenal partners there like Near for
example. Um and uh so a lot of lot of just unfinished business of fixing
broken windows getting things talk to each other. Um we're doing a lot of protocol
upgrades for Cardono like the governance was a huge lift. We went from federated system
to a fully decentralized governance system uh with onchain government even in a constitution and
things like that and that was like two years of

my life getting that done and getting that put together. So, we're real excited to
bring that to bear and to watch that fully realize itself. Um, including a full-on
chain treasury with 1. 8 billion ADA inside of it, which is close to $1.
8 billion. We're almost a dollar parody there. So, just a lot of stuff like
that. Um, in the nonweb 3 side, I I'm a bison rancher, got a buffalo
ranch, you know, they haven't killed me yet, but there's a few hundred running around.
I also run a healthcare clinic with my dad and

brother over in Gillette, Wyoming. We have 15,000 patients and 40 providers. So, we do
a lot of work with uh healthcare, especially rural healthcare and stem cells. So, it's
a very um diverse life these days. And I did this lovely 5-hour interview on
Sean Ryan show. If you guys want to see like the totality of all of
it, I'd highly recommend that episode. And you if you have a weekend to spare,
you can see the totality of what we're working on. >> Well, somebody asked you,
I've been following you since 2018. I see you as

a spiritual seeker. Do you ever see yourself dropping out of crypto and shifting your
main focus onto your spiritual practice. spiritual practice. >> Well, you know, I'm in crypto.
It's like everybody says, they have that meme with the Indian guy in the gold
shirt. I'm in it for the I'm in it for the technology. I'm I'm in
crypto for the spiritual side, for the philosophical side. And it gets lonely, man, cuz
I go to all these conferences and everybody's about the money and they're about the
connection. I I'm like I get along very well with

some of the old G's in the space because we were all in it before
there was any money. And uh I'm still there and I'm still tilting at windmills
like Don Kyote. you know, we say, "Hey, you know, can we be more decentralized
and hey, can we get power of the people and push it to the edges
and get all the non-custodial wallets. " So, uh, why. Because it's the moral thing
to do. I want to live in a world where the economic, political, and social
systems of the world are, uh, fair and decentralized and

they don't have single points of failure. And we have trust and honesty. Again, reality
is falling apart. If you haven't noticed, we can't trust each other anymore, can we.
It's like, oh, Trump wins, oh well, the election's rigged. If Trump loses, oh, the
election's rigged. You know, FBI, we we all we if your president's in, you love
him. If your president's out, you hate him. It's the same institution. I'm sorry. You
can't have institutions that every four years you go from we love them to we
hate them. I I mean, I wasn't too long ago

you had everybody on the left saying the NIH is the most credible organization in
the world and we all should get our vaccines and everything's great. And now they
say we can't believe anything coming out of the NIH because Robert Kennedy is there.
I can't live in that world where there's no anchors and institutions of objective reality.
So, we need systems to keep humans honest because we're no longer capable of doing
it ourselves, especially with generative AI where you can create a fake video or a
fake picture of anything you want and within just, you

know, 2 years to four years, it'll be photorealistic and perfect. So, you can't believe
your ears anymore. You can't believe your eyes anymore. So, we need some system to
rebalance society. So, this is where I am at and there's no way I'm going
to leave. I I I'm on the horse. I'm riding. It's It's getting harder every
day because it keeps getting faster and that horse gets meaner. But there's You'd have
to shoot me to get off the horse because I have a front row seat.
I'm riding towards the future of humanity. Within the next

10, 15 years, we're going to completely rebuild our voting systems, our economic systems, our
social systems to blockchain. And the winners and losers and the paradigms that win and
lose are going to completely decide the future of humanity. And the rest of us
as spectators, you you're just going to have to accept the consequences of winners or
losers. So we could have CBDC's CBDC's CBDC's and financial ponopticons like the People's Bank
of China is doing with the digital yuan. We could have completely free money like
Bitcoin or ADA and uh and have it be completely

uh private with human rights embedded inside of it. There's no law of physics that
says it has to be one way or the other way. It's social consensus based
on who wins through market conditions. So why you guys name when I get off
the horse and say let somebody else figure that one out. I I want to
be in this race because I want humanity to be liberated from all that. that.
>> Well, this is this is a perfect segue to my final question. I'll let
you go, Charles. This somebody asked uh this is a

great question. I saved this for the last. Uh somebody asked the future of crypto.
Um I'll just get the exact wording. So wording. So in the future, uh yeah,
how does he imagine the world. This is from a user on Reddit, MX Karum.
How does he imagine a world where there is full crypto adoption controlled by the
governments or controlled by corporations that manage to convince us to relinquish our keys in
return for protection or controlled by whales the 1% kind of a dystopian take on
all three scenarios but but but >> who would trade

liberty for security desire deserves neither and will lose both never ever trade liberty for
security you have to have liberty and we can't trust people to give it to
you either comes from God or from algorithms those are our two options okay and
uh God God hasn't been giving us very much lately, so the algorithms are going
to have to make up the diff. Uh so so I I'm in the game
and uh I want to win. I want the forces of decentralization and censorship resistance
and freedom of association and commerce expression to win. And

there's a collections of blockchain technologies that will make that happen. And there's collections of
technologies that won't. And there's no guarantee it's going to go one way or the
other. It is everything to do with how people buy things uh where they store
them and ultimately um the decisions they make and the agency that they take. they
take. Everything in the modern world is designed to rob you of agency. The news
robs you of critical thinking and an opinion. Banks rob you of self-custody. You know,
uh the central banks rob your money of its value.

It says a dollar, but they kill the dollar's value by debasing it. All these
things are pale similacra of their true intended purpose. And uh and so you got
to be skeptical and you got to take a step back and put your time
and faith in systems that by their design can't fail, by their design have integrity,
and then build back up society from that. If we're unwilling to do that and
we trade convenience for it, well then we'll lose and we'll end up creating a
dystopian panopticonal hellscape that makes Claus Schwab like hard every

day, you know. But I don't I don't want to live in that world, David.
I want to live I want to live in a world where we have freedom
and liberty and basic human rights. So uh so by 2035, we'll know. And it'll
come down to what's in the legislation. It'll come down to what technologies win and
it'll come down to what systems dominate. And I can't tell you, all I can
tell you is that I'm in the race and along with a few other good
people and we're all fighting hard against people who are

also in the race who are not good people. Well, uh we appreciate uh you
and uh what you've done for the community for blockchain and cryptos and uh we
hope you continue your good fight. So, thank you very much. Charles, where can we
learn more from you. Where can we follow you in the meantime. >> Oh, my
Twitter, IOHK Charles or I guess X. No, X. No, >> it's hard. I want
to call it Twitter, man. man. >> I know it slips out of the tongue.
It also you can say I tweeted. You can't see

I exed. It does a little bit little bit strange, but um >> they say
it's an X post. Like why would you give up a tweet. It's like >>
Yeah, but what is the actual verb now. Do we just say I posted on
X. It's a little bit little bit little bit >> Yeah, exactly. It's just like
what are we doing. we doing. >> I can talk to you for hours, Charles.
That was honestly a very good conversation. I hope you had fun and thank you
for coming on the show. >> Thanks, guys. Cheers. >>
