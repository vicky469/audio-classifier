the people, the users, the assets, the companies who issue those assets and the governments
who regulate those companies will find themselves on a decentralized network because it's the worst
option except for every other one. And I think ultimately decentralization will win by default.
default. >> Austin, >> Austin, >> Austin, >> I don't think we could ever get
away from the real world or the constraints of the real world and humans are
going to human. I think as a result, if we want to bring the majority
of real assets on chain, we're going to be forced

to acknowledge that reality. But I think the value of decentralized store of value systems
is by providing people an opt out. Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier
of internet money and internet finance. This is Ryan Sean Adams. I'm your only host
today. David's out. So, I'm here to help you become more bankless. We have a
debate episode today. I always love these. The debate is on the question of is
Ethereum ready for real world assets. Got two professors. I'm going to tell you first
what they share in common because I think that's interesting.

They are both previous bankless guests. They are both crypto advocates and they are both
longtime friends and also co-workers. So why is there a debate. Why is there daylight
between these two guests. Well, Austin on the one hand doesn't think Ethereum is a
good home for real world assets like stable coins and tokenized equities and all of
the things we expect to come on chain. He thinks the attributes that make Ethereum
decentralized, things like immutability, the element of code is law, these aren't so much features
for real world assets. They're bugs and he simply doesn't

think Ethereum is the right architectural fit. Omid on the other hand thinks that the
decentralization and the neutrality of Ethereum are exactly why the largest financial powers in the
world are selecting and will select Ethereum. These are the institutions. These are the sovereign
countries. They're going to trust Ethereum with our assets and liquidity because without decentralization after
all we're left with is a system like the one we already have. It's just
Trafi. This is a fascinating debate. I think it's a good point in the cycle
to talk about this as we continue to onboard more

and more financial institutions and traditional finance. Now, before we get into the episode, a
quick shout out to our friends over at Ronin. Ronin wants you to know that
they are coming home to Ethereum. They are Ethereum's Nintendo. Already today, the Ronin chain
has seen 4. 5 billion in NFT volume. That's like 30 million wallet downloads. And
actually a fun fact, you may know Ronin as the AXI Infinity chain of yester
year. Today, the Ronin chain actually has more onchain activity than at the peak of
the AXI boom in 2021. So they have grown fast

during the bare market and into this bull market. Now they are launching the Ronin
layer 2 on Ethereum. So Ronin is coming home. That's the news. It's going to
be 12 times faster because it borrows all the security and decentralization from Ethereum. Plus,
there are staking rewards in the form of the Ron token. That's RO N. And
this will now reward builders and their communities programmatically for adding value to Ronin. So,
you got to go check it out. Download the Ronin wallet. Get a taste of
the onchain Nintendo. There's a link in the show notes

Austin. It's coming right up. >> In the wild west of DeFi, stability and innovation
are everything, which is why you should check out FRA Finance, the protocol revolutionizing stable

move your tokens, make your next stop Uni Chain. First, liquidity. Uni Chain hosts the
most liquid UniS swap V4 deployment on any layer 2, giving you deeper pools for
flagship pairs like ETHUSDC. More liquidity means better prices, less slippage, and smoother swaps. Exactly
what traders crave. The numbers back it up. Uni Chain leads all layer 2s in
total value locked for Uniswap V4. And it's not just

deep. It's fast and fully transparent. Purpose-built to be the home base for DeFi and
crosschain liquidity. When it comes to costs, Uni Chain is a no-brainer. Transaction fees come
in about 95% cheaper than Ethereum mainet, slashing the price of creating or accessing liquidity.

today. Everyone loves debates and I think we're all going to enjoy this. The question
I think we're putting forward to the two gentlemen on

this episode is how much does decentralization matter. That's the wide sweeping question. What are
the implications for real world assets, for traditional finance, for government regulations, for cryptonnative assets.
And I have the perfect debate opponents to talk about this. Austin Campbell is a
professor at NYU Stern. He's a big stablecoin advocate and he's a repeat bank list
podcast guest. Austin, how you doing. doing. >> Doing quite well, thank you. And uh
excited to do this because as you get to Omid's intro, you'll find there's some
significant overlap between the two of us. us. >> Well,

we get to see what you agree on, what you uh disagree on. So, that'll
be interesting. Omid Makin is a professor at Colombia. He is also a longtime blockchain
crypto evangelist. Omid, welcome back to Bankless. >> Thank you. >> All right, so I
think the genesis for this conversation was like all great conversations started on Twitter or
the platform formerly known as Twitter on X and there was some back and forth
with you guys. I'll read a few uh quotes. Austin, I think this was maybe
a podcast uh video clip that um was uh was

put forward on X. You said this, I don't think Ethereum is ready for prime
time uh for prime time real world asset issuance. Then you gave an example of
the bybit hack. We're in a place where the Ethereum validators aren't willing to do
something about exploits. Omid, you pushed uh back a little bit. You said a blockchain
that isn't perfectly neutral is a terrible database worse than anything Tradfi has today. The
neutrality that Ethereum has optimized for more than any chain is the reason it's likely
to become the global settlement layer and attract endless trillions

in capital. Okay, first since I put you on the spot, uh Austin in a
defensive position, you said Ethereum is not ready for real world assets. What did you
mean by that. >> Yeah, so there's this central problem that you run into when
you're thinking about RWA, and it's something I used to think a lot about when
I was running a stable coin of you're fundamentally stuck between two worlds in terms
of the masters that you answer to. And maybe the best way to like make
this distinction clear is to start with something like Bitcoin,

right. And what I mean by that is Bitcoin is like stateless nons sovereign purely
programmatic money. And that's kind of fine in that there's no physical like representation of
Bitcoin in the real world that is answering to a sovereign government. like this is
purely an electronic construct and the network behaves in the way the network wants to
behave and fundamentally like as somebody who owns Bitcoin in ETF format before somebody tries
to rob me. I think like this is actually a very good invention for the
world and I'm in favor of it. The problem though

is to go the other way. Like let's take the example of like if we
tokenize ownership of houses and grandma's house title, right, is tokenized and somehow it gets
hacked and the North Koreans end up in possession of it. Like so like my
grandmother lived in Connecticut. Do you think the United States is going to let the
North Koreans evict her and move into her house. The answer is no. And so
there's this inherent tension with real world assets between what are the programmatic rules on
a blockchain and what are the actual factual rules in

the real world of how this asset is going to be adjudicated. And the tension
that you run into is if you can't make your ledger ultimately responsive to what
is going on in the real world, I would suggest that on a long enough
time frame it is certain that your ledger will eventually break. eventually break. >> Okay.
Is that does that get into the bybit hack. Why is that a relevant example
that you brought up. >> Okay, so the bybit hack starts to become a relevant
example for two reasons. Um, one, I was using it

as a demonstration of there is currently no real coordinated way within the Ethereum community
to handle these sorts of nation state level expropriations, right. Like put differently, the buy
bit hack this time was ETH. How would it have been handled differently if it
was, you know, a real world asset of some sort. And specifically, the interesting part
about the bybit hack to me is less the individual token targeted and more the
sophistication of the attack, right. Which is to say they got into bybit systems themselves
and compromised the people actually managing what was going on

internally. And this time it was bybit, but thought experiment for the crowd. What if
that had been Tether, right. What do you do if Tether loses control of their
own smart contract. >> Right. Right. So, in this case, it was a hack of
Ether. I believe primarily that was the the asset that was uh taken. And of
course, you know, um no government I I suppose could intervene. And you're saying, what
if this was the Tether smart contract. What would happen in that case or something.
>> Yeah. As a guy who ran a stable coin,

and this is the nature of like rolling discussions on a podcast, they can be
a little bit disorganized at times. But my my core concern is infosac is never
perfect. It is a matter of time on a long enough timeline until people get
hacked. And the question is how much damage it does and how do you recover
from it. And so my concern is if we're living in a world where it
is obvious that there are actors sophisticated enough to compromise people's internal security systems, what
like genuinely like what is the response if like Tether

or USDC has their smart contract compromised and how do you do that in a
way that doesn't then subsequently as you roll down the chain brick like you know
95% of things that are currently deployed in the world on Ethereum. >> Well OMI
those are some arguments for you. Uh what do you say. I say that um
the bite-bit hack is actually the best possible advertising Ethereum could have because the overwhelming
shrug that the community gave to calls of doing something about it even though it
was clearly big and was clearly some kind of a

very sophisticated actor. It wasn't one of those sometimes there's a issue on chain where
like somebody makes a mistake or one person claims a hacking and then the other
person know says no this was a legitimate transaction. The bite bit hack was a
great test case because it was like the perfect boogeyman scenario that anti-crypto people and
anti- bitcoin people had been telling us for like a decade which is that well
what are you going to do when literally North Korea steals a billion dollars worth
of money and uh Ethereum's response was absolutely nothing. And

I think that's great because neutrality is the only thing that blockchains could do well.
They don't do simplicity well. We all know how complicated they are. They don't do
performance well. They don't do cost well despite the efforts of my friends at Salana.
They don't do bandwidth and throughput well. Not by the standards of web 2 and
trafi. But the one thing they can do well is to say that we have
a network or a platform here that is always going to do exactly what it's
supposed to regardless of whatever legal, moral, or political order

somebody else wants to put on it. Now, clearly the BBIT hack was a bad
thing. So, I don't think this needs to be said, but I'll say it anyway.
Um, it's bad that it's happened. It's overall it's clearly bad for bite bit, bad
for their customers, bad for the price of eat during that period. But to me,
the northstar of all of this is to build infrastructure that the rest of society
could organize around because it is neutral and predictable in a way that very few
things, if anything, in the world currently is. And I

think the example that Austin gives is a really interesting one actually. I got to
give you credit Austin. never thought about the potential consequences of somebody like hacking uh
Tether or Circle's uh smart contract. I guess like they could just like mint a
trillion USDT, USDT, USDC, and that would definitely be catastrophic in DeFi. It would be
problematic everywhere. Um and far worse of an example than the Bitebit hack. So, I
appreciate you throwing that out there, but the question I have for you is like,
what do you propose to do about it. That risk

is out there, however small it might be. So, given you, we know what my
point of view is. Given your point of view, what would be the solution. I
think this gets into why I started with Bitcoin because with what you're saying about
something like Bitcoin itself or maybe ETH though in ETH's case because of proof of
stake there may be a long-term governance question like okay the buy bit hack happened
the North Koreans appear to have sold most of the ETH and moved on with
their life but if they kept it and staked it

and now we're participating in governance and then continue hacking people over time at some
point you have a structural problem. So, let's leave that aside. Uh, but just acknowledge
that, you know, we we'd have to think about that at some point, but that's
a pretty extreme scenario. I think what I am ultimately advocating for and why I've
raised this point is that there probably needs to be a different set of rules
of the road at the network level for what I will call cryptonative tokens like
ETH or Bitcoin and real world asset tokens, right. And

the reason for that is that ETH like itself definitionally made to your point about
what's valuable about it is not going to be like responsive to a federal judge,
right. Like somebody in the Southern District of New York can write an order ordering
all the ETH validators to do something and post it on the internet, then the
ETH validators can totally ignore that person and like move on with their lives and
there's basically nothing that's going to happen. On the other hand, if Tether's smart contract
gets hacked and that same order gets written to like

seize all the assets because the North Koreans appear in control of it and they
show up at Caner Fitzgerald's office, who by the way is managing Tether's reserves and
are like, "Here you go. " Guess what happens there. Caner hands over all the
reserves. So my point is because there are two very different legal structures behind call
it cryptonative things and things that are grounded in the real world and definitionally not
decentralized. I think the network probably needs to be willing to roll back or have
some sort of way to handle a hack of Tether

in a way that it does not need for ETH because you know actually you
raised this point earlier which I think was very astute when you were speaking is
if Tether's smart contract gets hacked and the pat answer that you'll get from a
lot of people is well tether can just drop a new smart contract what's the
problem repudiate the old one drop a new one I would point out to everybody
that nukes basically every single DeFi protocol that has tether integrated into them in the
current like design of the ecosystem. Like unis swap is

not robust to that. A is not robust to that. Compound is not robust to
that. Like you now have pools that are immutable that exist that people can transact
against that have a thing in there that's now completely worthless in sort of a
one-step jump. And this is where I get to the requirement of network controls. Like
for the audience, by the way, Omid and I go back like a decent ways
at this point. We both worked at city. And so I would like to make
the point that holding traditional financial or really any human

institution to the standard of not making mistakes can be easily refuted by our old
employer because while we were both there, they sent I mean what was it like
$800 million to the wrong people in the Revlon thing. Like a a hilarious like
error. Um and by the way, anybody if you trust that your bank knows what
they're doing, boy are you wrong. Um, and so like my my point is even
if we leave malfeasants aside, like it is a matter of time until somebody just
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up, right. Because I posed like what

if Tether's smart contract gets hacked. But maybe here's a more hilarious one. What if
somebody just loses the private keys, right. Like you need obviously I think Tether please
has better controls than that, but like you need ways to like recover from these
sorts of human error things as well. But again, if somebody loses the keys to
their private wallet and it's ETH, so be it. That was the deal that you
made to use this product. And I think I agree with Omid, by the way.
The value at the base layer for that token is

the decentralization. I think the problem is again, you can't be like, well, grandma lost
the key to her NFT. She can never sell her house again. Like the woman's
dead, we can't settle the estate. 500 years from now, nobody lives there. Uh, so
Austin, it almost seems like you're saying for immutability on the layer 1 in particular
is a bug for real world assets where it's it's a feature for cryptonative assets.
Um, what do you say to this. to this. >> That is exactly what I
am saying right is that real world assets are not

immutable and I'll just let Omid go. >> I don't know who's ever argued that
we should turn houses into bearer assets, but I'm clearly not one of them. So
I I don't that to me is a bit of a uh is a bit
of a straw man argument like no one there was this idea back in the
day like eight years ago that we're going to put deeds on the blockchain. This
was really one of the endless manifestations of the blockchain not Bitcoin thesis but like
even back then nobody said oh well we should have

it be an NFT that anybody could hack and steal. But I I like this
Tether example because if I understand you correctly, Austin, you're saying that because the smart
contract is vulnerable to hacking, we should introduce a mechanism at the network layer to
undo certain kinds of hacking. Is that right. >> I'm going to be very careful
with what I say about network layer here. I think there are multiple like potential
solutions to this problem. But I think the thing you need to introduce at the
network layer is the requirement to have one of those

solutions in place if you are going to put RWA on the network. Let me
posit two worlds. one option and by the way this exists like you could create
an avalanche like subnet or L1 or whatever you want to call it with this
technology of we've got a permission validator set with a hard boundary and like delays
to get something off the chain so in that case if somebody had deployed a
stable coin and the smart contract gets hacked the validator set can be like whoa
and that I think om you would classify as a

network level control control control >> another one for instance could be theoretically if we
build the DeFi ecosystem properly so that every smart contract that adopts a token has
sort of call it a kill switch built into it and if some oracle that
we've all agreed upon throws the kill switch the smart contracts just freeze you can
no longer transact with them and all you can do is withdraw assets that might
be an adequate response to something like the tether smart contract risk as well because
again my concern is this like let's right now go

look on like unis swap and be like how much ETH versus USD DT is
there on there. I also think it's very dangerous to live in a world where
if USDT gets compromised and we agree the old contract is worth zero, somebody just
goes and drains that pool, right. That would be telling LPS like you have systemic
risk to this ecosystem and basically Tether getting hacked sends ETH to zero, which I
think is bad for ETH. And thus my point is it's it's not just the
validators where the solution could reside, but I do think

it's probably the validators that need to enforce you need to have some kind of
solution guys here. Don't just put ticking time bombs on our chain. >> So what
happens when North Korea hacks the permission validators on an avalanche subnet or the agreed
upon oracle that triggers the kill switch on important smart contracts. Cuz the way I'm
hearing you, you're worried about a specific risk for a specific coin, Tether smart contracts,
and your solution is to introduce a universal risk to the chain or a universal
risk to literally every smart contract that has this hack

switch. And by the way, permission chains have been hacked, oracles have been hacked. So
these are not theoreticals. The Tether one is >> simple answers to some of those
things. I actually on the first one go back to something that I learned way
back in the day in catastrophe risk which is an area where I would say
blockchains have currently failed pretty badly which is what is your fail state right so
like the reason I raised an oracle specifically only with a kill switch is my
fail state there is okay well we can't transact with

those LP pools but everybody can withdraw damaging in some form like somebody throwing that
is really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] annoying but it doesn't fundamentally like destroy things in the that actually
continuing to transact with the smart contract itself got hacked would right and the reason
I raise this is it has to do with how you think about engineering in
general like a good example of this principle gone wrong was Fukushima right where you
should be building your nuclear reactors such that if you lose power they shut down
not cause like a completely out of control chain reaction

and you know if you look at like modern designs of nuclear reactors they're going
to hold your control rods that'll stop a nuclear reaction with electromag magnets so that
definitionally if you lose power they drop the rods. Yeah, it breaks your nuclear reactor
but you don't have an uncontrolled meltdown. Okay. And I'm arguing if you want to
think about risks in smart contract world you should probably be building things that way
cuz yes it would be painful to wake up and have been an LP and
be like well I expected my LP would be working

and instead like everything is frozen and all I could do is withdraw my assets.
Okay, I guess. But that's way less painful than just losing all your assets. So
one of those is thinking about fail states. Two, if the North Koreans are able
to hack an entire permission validator network and you had a large enough permissioning set
with differential security protocols, so be it. And what I mean by that is at
some point the financial system is financially systemic. You could have some amount of redundancy,
but like equivalently, if the North Koreans can hack like

zel for all of the major banks simultaneously and then start sending themselves money, there's
probably not a lot you could have engineered to stop that. But that feed is
significantly harder than hacking merely one bank. So, I agree with you. At some point,
the risk is non-diversifiable, right. Like for instance, ETH is always catastrophically exposed to a
meteorite striking the planet, destroying Earth, right. Like the value goes to zero. Okay, I
get it. But I am saying there are like well-known things we can do here
to build a much more resilient ecosystem and thus one

that also isn't inevitably probably in like a decade period as opposed to like a
thousands of year period like going to brick itself when we get into a fight
with the real world legal system because all of this omade to go back to
the original point comes down to when I'm running a stable coin in the back
of my mind is always my custodian is going to respond to the US government
whether I like it or not. >> Sure. But um Ryan, correct me if I'm
wrong. The Ronin hack was a majority multi-IG validator set

that was it the Lazarus group that hacked and stole hundreds of millions of dollars.
>> Yeah, I believe so. That's what's been reported. Yeah. 400 some million. Um the
bybit hack, by the way, for listeners, was this happened in February 21st, 2025. This
was a 400,000 ETH hack of the Bybit cold wallet. So that's about 1. 4
to 1. 5 billion at the time. So these are pretty large hacks. So I
bring that up because I just want to point out that a Austin's Tether smart
contract example remains theoretical. the having a permission chain be

hacked by North Korea example did happen uh and was quite costly and if I
recall correctly a lot of it was a social engineering hack which is very very
very or easier to do when you have a permissioned validator set of any kind
and you know who they are you know where their computers are you know who
their employees are and um you can figure out the back doors that way. Now,
if the argument is that DeFi protocols should be more thoughtful about what kind of
fail safes they integrate into their smart contracts to handle

with certain scenarios. I think that's a different argument. Um, I still think the most
important DeFi protocols will not do that. I would encourage a for example or unis
swap to never do that because at the end of the day the guaranteed outcomes
that they provide the 99. 99% the 99. 99% of their users and transactions that
are not problematic is not worth bastardizing in order to deal with a black swan
event. But if other nonfunddamental DeFi protocols want to say, "Hey, our smart contracts actually
have some kind of a um fail safe built in

like Austin's nuclear example. " I think that would be an interesting experiment. Um, in
the long run, I think they would end up attracting a lot less capital because
the people who would use them would sit there and say like, "Okay, but what
if the back door is hacked, which happens, or what if the back door is
somehow weaponized to harm my transaction, right. " the planning ahead as Austin said I
think one of the things we both agree on is that we are headed to
a future when one way or another trillions of dollars

will live on chain of native assets and RWAs and other things in between and
in preparing for that world I think the infrastructure that says you can always expect
reliable outcomes will win over the ones that say most of the time you can
expect reliable outcomes. But sometimes it either one of our engineers gets socially hacked or
a government compels us, everything goes out the window and you have no idea what
protections you're going to have, right. That's not a bad thing. That's just a tradey
thing. That's a web two thing that the world already

has. So then the people who would bring their capital on chain, they would say,
"Wait a minute. I thought the reason why I'm coming on chain is I'm going
to get censorship resistance, but now you're telling me actually no, there's a sensor censorship
mechanism. They're going to think, I thought the reason I was coming on chain is
because I'm going to have composability. But you can't have composability if the smart contracts
of one DeFi protocol have a switch that can then deny access to the transactions
required from another protocol. And then they're going to say,

I thought I thought we're going to have transparency. If I use a completely permissionless,
no failsafe switch a I know exactly what the code is and how it works
and what it's going to do. But it would be prudent if you do have
a fail safe to not advertise exactly how it works because then you know the
hackers would figure out how to hack it. So then the wouldbe DeFi users are
going to say, "Okay, so you're going to tell me that it's something that may
or may not do what it's supposed to and has

some mechanism that I cannot know that might be triggered to stop a transaction which
I would have been the beneficiary of. " Right. Again, that's not a bad thing.
I'm not here to argue against the world being this like cold mechanical libertarian. Everything's
a bearer asset. the smart contracts do whatever they're supposed to do even if like
the end of humanity is upon us. >> Code is law. I'm just saying that
the assets that want or need neutrality are going to optimize for that. And if
they don't want to need those things, they should really

not be on any of these permission chains because those are just bad databases and
we have much better databases offchain. >> Well, let's get to that in a second.
I I want you to strengthen the argument of, you know, Austin's more extreme example
of not sort of a a fail safe on smart contracts, but a more extreme
example would actually um have Ethereum validators do something about some of these exploits. So,
me, I I think you're pretty against that. Uh and tell me why. Why are
you against that. The idea that uh Ethereum validators or

any validator of a layer 1 system can kind of roll back the chain or
interfere in some of these transactions. Why why is that a bad idea. So, it's
one thing to talk about that in the abstract, like in a magical world, it
would be great if that was a feature that worked, right. First, I question how
you would implement it because we've all seen firsthand how messy and often um broken
governance is on decentralized systems, right. And this is effectively going to be a new
governance mechanism, except it's a governance mechanism where like the

fate of the chain and maybe a hundred trillion dollars are in its hands. So
I would put that back on Austin to explain to us exactly what this solution
looks like. Who decides when action is taken. Is there voting. Is there onchain coordination.
Is there offchain coordination. Because part of my sort of like do nothing recommendation, Ryan,
is based on the fact that when you say no, no, no, do something and
you start getting into the weeds of what the something might be. um you open
up a whole new can of worms. >> We'll get

Austin to weigh in in a second, but I want to add this uh get
get your thoughts on this uh Omid, which is maybe what Austin is arguing, and
we can ask him. He's right here, but maybe what he's arguing is not so
much, you know, you want to have uh validators be able to kind of reverse
transactions on the chain. Just ignore that for a second. What he's saying more is
if you have a completely immutable permissionless decentralized chain, maybe that's not the place for
real world assets. That's another, you know, tactic you would

take. And in fact, this is sort of what Bitcoin does. You know, Bitcoin, what
is the Bitcoin network. Well, it's just for moving Bitcoin essentially, and everything else goes
off chain. Ethereum has this blend where it has all sorts of tokens, some real
world tokens, some cryptonative tokens. Any token you want to deploy, you can put and
you inherit the the properties of Ethereum. So maybe he's just saying real world assets
don't belong there on Ethereum. Ethereum. >> Are you awesome. >> I mean, I is
I do think what's the right way to say this.

There is some internal hypocrisy in the current arguments around Ethereum that there is not
in Bitcoin for exactly the reasons that Ryan just raised, right. Like if I were
to take these concerns to the Bitcoin community, the answer that I get from the
Bitcoin people is cool that don't put that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on our chain. To which I'm
like, well, you know what, that's intellectually honest, right. Like I think that may put
an in the long term an upward cap on Bitcoin prices, but what you've said
to me is completely intellectually honest of like get that

[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of here because I mean like the core point I would make to
you is real world assets, it's not a back door, it's the front door, right.
Like the responsiveness to real world legal systems is the core feature of the product
and you have to deal with that whether you like it or not. Because essentially
here's what I'm saying and where I sort of bring in the hypocrisy here. Like
if I'm running a stable coin and my reserves are US treasuries, the number one
group of people I am responsive to is US lawmakers,

regulators, and like judicial persons. Period. Full stop. Like no judge, none in the United
States is going to be like, "Well, you know, some random anonymous validators say that
the North Koreans own your money now, so we're going with that. " They're going
to be like, "Absolutely [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] not. " Like, we have OFAC. I understand what the
concerns are. We have sanctions law. Seize those assets. The coin is pricricked. But c
can can can we go into that Austin too. It's like let's describe what that
means too. I mean >> yeah let me finish the

bridge and then we'll come back to that which is to say I am asserting
this which is if you want on your chain to have tokenized real world assets.
You really really really need some multiply redundant mechanisms to make sure that your chain
can be responsive to the real world legal frameworks that govern those assets. Because if
you do not have that and you not have call it like error catching around
that take the tether example it is a matter of time until you brick the
asset cuz the real world like legal process will win.

There's a lot of people with a lot of guns who are going to enforce
that. >> Whose legal process. >> So if you're doing this is the problem is
the answer to that is it depends on your real world asset. If I'm talking
about like a US dollar stable coin it will be the United States of America.
If I'm talking about gold that is custody at the London Metals Exchange, it's the
United Kingdom, right. If I'm talking about like, you know, call it tokenized deposits for
a bank in Hong Kong, it's fundamentally China. And look,

I don't have an answer to the fact that the real world is messy. The
real world is messy. But I'm saying if you want to inherit real world assets
onto your chain, you have to have a reckoning with the fact that that is
the case. And there are many, many disperate views on that. Again, this is not
a reputation of like do it this way for the ETH token or Bitcoin, but
it sure as hell is to say if you have a US dollar stable coin
and the US government disagrees with you, I don't think

your blockchain is going to win. win. >> So, I think the appeal of going
on chain is that the asset regulated in the US, the asset issued out of
custody in London, and the asset controlled in Hong Kong could coexist with the natively
issued asset like ETH. I think that is a killer application because all of these
parties for the first time ever, I except maybe when they ship gold back and
forth to each other, could use a way to interact with each other economically that
no other party could impose their will on it. That

the US users will say, you know what, I'm going to use these this neutral
blockchain because China doesn't control it. And the Chinese users are going to feel exactly
the same way. And I'm not, this is not a east versus west thing. And
the London tokenized gold issuer is going to be like, "Hey, look, here's a blockchain
that has a trillion dollars and a trillion yuan, and that's where I want my
tokenized gold to be because then people could borrow and lend against it. " When
you talk, Austin, about well, the real world asset legal

systems plural are not going to tolerate this, right. And that's why the chain to
attract their assets should have some kind of a control mechanism or or um exception
handling, error control, whatever you want to call it, right. Then what I think is
you are headed for a world where some transaction involving the a US party and
a Hong Kong party happens and then the Chinese authorities go to the chain and
say this is an invalid transaction. You must stop it. And then almost immediately President
Trump tweets no it's a valid transaction. and it must

go through and now you have destroyed your censorable or or failsafe blockchain because it's
become completely politicized. So my argument is if these assets are going to go on
chain, they are going to go on the chain where everybody's treated equally. And that
treatment is we don't care. You get hacked here, you get robbed there, you make
a mistake there, the Chinese government wants us to do something, the US government wants
us to do the opposite thing. We have no power to change any of it.
I think that is going to attract far more users

and assets than it's going to repel because by the way also as you know
better than most of our listeners most of the world's most valuable payment systems already
work that way right whether it's Fed wire or counterpart in almost every other country
these RTGS or realtime gross settlement systems have a rule which is that the intermediary
which in this case is literally or Almost have always the central bank is not
getting involved in dispute resolution. Which is why the example that you brought up from
City Bank is they accidentally wired out hundreds of millions

of dollars. The only way they could get it back is to go to court
and use the legal system to sue the recipient to give him the money back.
And first they lost and now I think they went on appeal. But the most
important thing is the Fed's position, right. the mother of all centralized trafi jackal island
intermediaries who processes trillions of dollars in payments a day. Their position is we are
neutral. Not our problem. You make a mistake not our problem. The the central bank
of Pakistan was hacked and the money was routed through

Fed wire and the Fed's response was not our problem. So given Trafi recognizes the
importance of neutrality when it comes to important transactions. I actually don't think it's that
far of a reach to say that, hey, that's how the blockchain's going to work.
Unlike Fed Wire, though, it's going to be for different currencies and tokens and NFTTS
and whatever. And I think the Trafy mind, if we could call it that, will
be like, "Oh, oh, okay. You're doing the same thing that every central bank does,
but in a more universal way. " Well, for the

same reason that I'm glad the central bank is neutral, I'm glad that the blockchain
is neutral. I'm going to move my assets on there. Well, I'm so I'm going
to say I don't think this is a correct description of how the Federal Reserve
operates because I agree with you. They are neutral for the people that they choose
to let on their network. And boy, does Caitlyn Long have some things to say
about that for instance. And also, if people are repeat offenders, they will totally kick
them off their network. So, one of the things that

the Fed is doing, and I think we should both like just say this for
the listeners, is they are highly permissioned as to who gets to use the Fed
infrastructure to send payments in the first place. So, they part of why they can
be like, well, you made a mistake. You made a mistake because it's big boys
only who are there by permission. Like, you had to be led into the club
by the bouncer, right. The bouncers being the group that gives master accounts at the
Federal Reserve. And then two, boy, do they do bank

supervision, right. like these are people going into all of the members and like observing
them, auditing them, setting rules and procedures. Like this is not just you show up
and you get to do what you want. So I will concede if you were
to create like an L1 blockchain where the validators and the people using it were
permissioned in the way that the Fed does, I'd be a lot more chill about
neutrality, but we've just eliminated 99. 999% eliminated 99. 999% of users for blockchains because
now it's just big banks. So part one there. Part

two, I think the hypothetical world that you have proposed where there are these permissionless
trades on blockchains and nation states can't intervene does not exist and is not the
world we live in. I think the hypothetical you gave of what if Donald Trump
starts shouting about this is valid or not valid is unfortunately the one we are
already in with real world assets because again I will go back to the point
of the unfortunate reality that we face is actually let's take your example because I
think it was a really good one. We have a

world where we have ETH, we have tokenized gold in London, we have a Chinese
stable coin, and we have an American stable coin. I'm going to use Chinese and
American because the assets just need to reside there. Like you could have a weird
like Euro, American, fine, whatever. But there's a Chinese and American one. Here's what I'm
saying is the way the chain ultimately functions whether you like it or not. And
the question is just does your code reflect the real world reality. reality. London controls
how the gold token operates. China controls how the Chinese

stable coin operates and America controls how the American stable coin operates. Because if you
could brick the reserve and brick the issuer, you control the coin. And I agree
with you, Omid, there are things governments can do that would destroy the value proposition
of the chain or at least using that specific asset on the chain. But the
problem is, yeah, like that's just the way it is. I don't like that, right.
I do think there could be better real world frameworks but I think that requires
a lot of legal right and regulatory reform that has

not occurred yet because here's the fundamental problem with your system. Let us say that
China says no this trade did not occur and goes and joins the issuer from
like ever withdrawing the money for those tokens and just confiscates it. Now what right
like it's just broken on chain forever if you cannot represent that reality on your
blockchain. And so what I am fundamentally saying here is that decentralization that decentralization that
decentralization is a feature in situations where there's lack of trust and people want neutrality.
I agree with you on that. But it is a

bug in situations where the underlying asset itself is not decentralized and by creating this
fiction that something can be decentralized that does not interact well with reality, all you're
doing is stuffing a live grenade into the system. That almost sounds like you're against
stable coins though >> because yeah, they have the freeze and seize capability and even
if like Circle doesn't want to implement it, the US government could always uh jail
Jeremy Aair, which you know, we we hope not. We like Jeremy. like Jeremy. >>
Well, the US government has never jailed anybody in crypto

for like sanctions or money issues money issues money issues >> or or yeah, trumped
up charges. So, but that's to me, ironically, another reason why we want neutral infrastructure
because neutral infrastructure creates a competitive playing field for different kinds of assets, including ones
that are issued from offchain, RWA, stable coins, etc. And ultimately if you do have
a world where a becomes the repo market which I think it could um but
you have tokenized treasuries and tokenized dollars and very large financial institutions all over the
world are borrowing and lending against each other. The stable

coin that ends up dominating that market is going to be the one that has
the most perceived neutrality. it is not going to be the one that has the
most built-in fail safes and kill switches because everybody in Trafi understands that that could
be weaponized against them, right. Like counterparty risk is something that's drilled into the DNA
of risk managers like you actually when you used to be one, right. So, they
understand that and they're going to say, "I'm not worried about me being hacked and
then not having a way to stop the hack because

I can address that problem by making my infrastructure, my wallet, my custodian more robust.
" They're going to think I'm more concerned about a counterparty weaponizing counterparty weaponizing counterparty
weaponizing some kind of an error resolution system to undo a trade where I made
money or that was vital to me. And because of that, they're going to be
more attracted to the RWAs that are the most neutral. I think they're actually going
to be the ones that advertise this. Just like Apple has made a fundamental part
of its brand to be privacy. They put up billboards

that say, "We protect your privacy. " And they even stood up to the US
government after an actual terrorist attack, right. And they say, "We will not help you
break that iPhone because we protect privacy. " I think they're going to be real
world asset issuers that advertise themselves on neutrality and then they win. So whether it's
dollars or euros or remimi or gold, whatever it is, we'll see how the balance
of uh global asset preferences shift over time too. If you have a neutral blockchain,
it's going to attract more neutral assets, including the ones

that are issued offchain. They'll never be fully neutral, but there will be a CEO
of a stable coin issuer who advertises himself as willing to go to jail in
order to fight against some kind of a court order from some government. And then
the market will ultimately attract more and more of these assets. And then you're like
the little smaller London tokenized gold issuer. you're going to think, I want my gold
token to be the winner because that's how I make money, right. My vested personal
interest is to make my gold token neutral. So, you

get this sort of like network effect of the RWA is becoming more and more
resilient. And the final boss in all this, I think we all agree, is the
government, right. I think the governments that want their currency to be more widely adopted,
which is all of them, well, almost all of them, maybe not the Swiss. Um,
and the asset issuers, whether it's they're tokenizing tokenizing tokenizing commodities or equities or whatever,
right. They're all going to want to win the neutrality race. And then the governments
who want their businesses to win, who want their currencies

to win, who want their version of the US Treasury or the actual US Treasury
bond to win, they're all going to say, "You know what. We want to win
the neutrality Olympics because then we get more money, more spending, more jobs, more taxes.
So if you start with this base infrastructure that is neutral, I think it creates
a cascading effect where the assets become neutral and then the issuers of the assets
become more neutral and the final boss, the governments that issue those assets are going
to be more willing to be neutral than they are

today. So, I would say I don't think as of yet that's been shown to
be the true revealed market preference for real world assets. Like I I actually think
you've just made an exceptional argument in favor of Bitcoin to be totally honest with
you, right. Like I know all three of us like believe in Bitcoin to some
extent in addition to ETH as an asset. So like I think this one we're
preaching to the choir on, but I would tell you like you could create a
stable coin like that, but the costs of it are

very high, right. Like I would need to find some sort of relatively neutral offshore
jurisdiction and the assets I'm going to need to hold are like physical [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bills
in a vault so that they're not responsive to judicial procedures. And then I'm going
to need a bunch of people to defend the thing. Like Eric Prince and I
are going to need to have a contract, right. So that we could keep this
stuff secure. And by the way, all of that is actually doable. And in fact,
I think you and I both know a lawyer who's

thought about the joking idea of a central bank physical currency, right. Like you could
if you want to like descend into like levels of madness go like Hideo Kajjima
Metal Gear style like let's create a like offshore military contractor that holds all the
currency type behavior. But the costs of that are high and the market has shown
zero adoption preference for that. It just wants [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's highly liquid globally. And I
think what I'm getting at here is like asset preferences are not monolithic. And there
appear to be a lot more people I think than

you would like who are willing to make the tradeoff to have liquidity. I also
think government is final boss is something we will never get away from. Like government
is just a word for the things we do together. And you know in many
ways like we're talking about reordering how we think about human civilization which m maybe
maybe down the road this will occur but it is not a decades thing. That
is a centuries thing. And so I'm saying in the world we live in today,
like it or not, the revealed preferences are for highly

liquid centralized stable coins and crypto exchanges. Um, and that these are responsive to real
world like legal systems whether we like it or not. And to live in that
reality without breaking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's going to be a matter of time until blockchains need
to find a way to be responsive to real world legal procedures. By the way,
I think the rubber is about to meet the road on this globally for stable
coins in a way it has not because of the passage of Genius. Like if
you go read that bill, there are some serious hooks

in there with regard to like ecosystem monitoring and responsiveness to court orders and like
law enforcement. And I'm going to tell you, knowing something about how US regulators regulate
foreign banks, they're going to tell you if you want to have a USissued token,
that means your foreign entity is also responsive to us on all of those things.
So you are going to find explicitly US dollar stable coins responding to US freeze
and seize orders going forward. And I think my point is we live in a
world where Omid your negative case is actually just the

base case. Like that is what's going on right now. But I'm not endorsing that
as good. But I am saying that's the world we live in. And so the
reason I would say to bring this all the way back around to Ryan's initial
question cuz like unsurprisingly with you and me on here sent us down a rabbit
hole immediately which is amazing is the core reason I said I think ETH is
unprepared is what is the right way to say this. I think you think some
of these concerns are highly speculative. They may be less

speculative than you think and people may have already been fighting about them in private.

on this, right, this this point that OMI is making with respect to neutrality. One
thing we have seen with the Genius Act is of

course nation state support of a stable coin in the US. We've not seen the
EU move. We have not seen India move. We have not seen China move. What's
very interesting to me about this is um we already have the swift network essentially
which is kind of a US controlled I know it's a European sort of entity
administered but it's basically a US controlled payment apparatus. China is uh creating their own
payment network something called SIPs. That's sort of the you know China controlled ability to
freeze you know whatever they want done on on SIPs.

we don't have a credibly neutral third player that has entered. Maybe part of the
argument that Omid is making is well that's Ethereum that's the the layer one here
and so yeah what China the question for China or the EU or for any
or India or any sovereign country is which set of chains are you going to
deploy on and it seems to be the case that you'd want to deploy on
a chain on a payment network essentially that couldn't be freezed by another sovereign country
and potentially your adversary when it comes to the EU

and making a decision in terms of which chain to issue their currency, wouldn't you
think neutrality would be a factor. When it comes to China, don't they want to
deploy to something that the US can't intervene in, can't censor in. Like, what do
you make of that argument. Because we have started to see the rubber meets the
the road, but that's only in the US. Once we have geopolitical adversaries and interests
uh, you know, colliding, won't they prefer neutrality. to Omit's point. >> Well, I I
would remind everybody Europe has moved. They have Mika. It's

just terrible and broken because in the classic European fashion, they misunderstood the problem and
so created basically bank captured tokenized deposits that can only function within Europe. So, golf
clap guys good work. So, right, I might argue Europe's revealed preference is actually no,
we just want to control things that don't want to be a blockchain at all
and we'll just, you know, essentially take it in the face economically for that choice.
Um, Europe has clearly not been prioritizing growth for a long time. And this goes
back to kind of the point I was making that

you were saying about where is the credible neutrality. I agree with you. They want
a blockchain that cannot be unilaterally dominated in all ways by their nation state adversaries.
But here is the problem that you're going to run into for instance with China
is they're going to tell you we don't want to be on a chain that
the United States is in control of like unilaterally but we also aren't deploying on
a chain where we can't control our own currency because that will obliterate our currency
controls. So you get into this sort of prisoners dilemma

or if you will Mexican standoff if we start incorporating the EU too where like
everybody wants to have the control over their thing but they don't want other people
to have control over their thing right so like China doesn't want the US to
run their currency and the US doesn't want China to run their currency the EU
is not okay with either of them running their currency and so on and so
forth but also all of them want like a place to transact and this is
sort of why I'm coming back to if you want

on a blockchain that can simultaneously be the warehouse of the majority of RWA and
actually trade, call it more freely amongst each other, certainly more freely than the current
very sort of siloed global network. But you also want it to be something that
people will actually use. What you're getting into is a system where it's local responsiveness
to local tokens only, right. Like China can't tell the US how a US token
works and the US can't tell China how a China token works. But they need
to be able to tell themselves how the tokens work.

Cuz if you don't do that, while I agree with you that ETH will have
some value, it's essentially going to become the trading venue only for limited forms of
FX and maybe certain forms of physical commodities. Securities will not be on there. Derivatives
will not be on there. Many forms of trade finance will not be on there.
so on and so forth cuz like once things start breaking with real world legal
systems like you're just done right like congratulations I have a token that's non-representative of
the economics of the real world it has no value

to me and so this this is back to like I think there's some nuance
to this argument that's very important which is I'm not fighting with people about the
properties of ETH or Bitcoin and I am not saying we should have a chain
where the US just gets to dictate everything but I am to go back to
the real world is messy point saying if we want to tokenize the maximum number
of assets and maybe that's not your goal. We can come back to that in
a minute. But if you want to tokenize the maximum

number of assets, you're going to need a real world system where you can revert
some of these things because like simply put to go back to the basic examples
like the North Koreans are not moving into grandma's house in Connecticut and they're not
getting a board seat on Apple if they somehow like hack the Apple stock contract
and steal a bunch of it. Like it's not happening. And so you would need
a chain that can reflect those legal frameworks one way or another. another. >> I
still don't understand what your solution is. You just made

a more eloquent argument than I could as to how messy legal frameworks are in
an international geopolitical setting. And then you're saying and I want a blockchain that's accountable
to all of them. Like I I really like how does it work. What's the
consensus mechanism. What's the governance. Like in the event that China wants to dispute a
stable coin transaction, do they file a form. Is there a website. And then where
does it go. You're going to have validators, right. And you tell me what consensus
mechanism you're running. What is the process by which they

decide that this messy Chinese request that is now being disputed by a messy American
request is going to resolve in the chain. something simple like we're going to freeze
a transaction. How would that work. >> I think the punchline on how you make
those things work is unfortunately relatively simple and I think most crypto people are not
going to like this. Um, back to your prespecifying systems. If I were designing a
blockchain and I were thinking about tokenizing real assets at scale on that chain, I
would want for each asset when it's deployed to have

to specify who does it think it's answerable to and to have the network agree
with that definition for the thing to exist. So I guess what I'm fundamentally saying
is I think the permissioning might need to exist at the do you get to
put your token on here layer which is probably an unsatisfactory answer to a lot
of people in crypto and I understand that but would solve this problem pretty well
which is to say USDC would drop and say we are responsive to like the
US government and US states and that is the answer

and if you want us to do something go to them and if you don't
like that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off cuz that's how it works for us right like deal and
then it would be relative relatively simple. Again, obviously you want to get the security
model properly. Don't just do this with like a single point of failure one to
have some sort of oracle network that like reposts US court orders and the chain
will enforce whatever those are. Code them properly, right. Like we could have standards here.
That doesn't bother me. But like we need some way

to communicate effectively in this vector. And so if China comes and says, well, we
have a problem with this USDC transaction. The answer that the chain gives because it's
already set these rules in advance is cool. go to a US court and get
an order or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off, right. But it will also work the other way with
China is my point is like the United States, Donald Trump can't just stand up
and be like, I don't like that transaction that happened with the Chinese CBDC on
this chain, so reverse it. They'll be like, dog, go

get a court order from China. It says it right there. That's the only thing
we can enforce. So, I'm not against even OM to your point like immutability with
regard to those rules. My point is just what the rules are probably needs to
reflect how the real world works because if they don't, you have a problem. And
again, what we may be getting around to here is an argument that actually most
assets should not be tokenized. tokenized. >> Yeah, you just you just proposed Swift. >>
Yeah, I was going to say to what extent is

what you said different than what we have today in in Tradfi. Okay, so here
is actually a core point where I think a blockchain is vastly superior to what
we have in Tradfi and something that I think people underdisuss which is I know
decentralization is a buzzword for a lot of people in crypto but I'm going to
make maybe the hot take here that I'm not sure that's the most important feature
of blockchains. I actually think it may be the open access and composability that matters
more because one of the problems like let's go back

to Amid's example of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve system works like this conditional
upon you being allowed into the system. And that conditioning is the point of a
huge amount of corruption and like political contention and like arguments. Blockchains don't operate like
a private club. They operate like a public park. That is to say, your default
is you can come in here and if you start doing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we don't like,
maybe we can kick you out. Some of them are not even like that. They're
just like, even if you're doing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we don't like,

you can stay forever. But at least some of them are designed in the way
of like the default is you get to come in and then we have to
kick you out for bad behavior. That change alone is a dramatic and extremely important
difference compared to the traditional financial system. The second part is that blockchains kind of
function as like a layer cake. Again, back to what Omid and I have been
talking about here. And I think the two of us intuitively understand this. So, let
me expose it better for like the people at home

just to drive the point home. And OM pile in if you disagree, but like
one of our complaints with the current system is also that it's incredibly fragmented and
toolated. Like for me to get a bank account in like Singapore and get a
bank account in Switzerland and get a bank account in Dubai and get a bank
account in the it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sucks, right. And like a lot of people functionally cannot
do it, right. But again, with a blockchain, you now have all of these like
in a single layer cake where people globally can transact

in ways that previously they were not. So that's part one. Part two, the composability.
Like let me propose a hypothetical for people. If you have a great business idea
that would be value additive for the world and consumers on which you're not going
to charge egregious fees, but the problem is you need to build it on top
of the Chase banking app and the Apple store, what do you think your odds
of success are, right. It's basically zero cuz Chase can just block you or brick
you at any point they want. And so the other

part of blockchains that I think people have really underdised and sort of like undervalued
is the composability component, right. Like part of what's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cool about DeFi primitives
like Uniswap, like a is not just that they exist on a standalone basis. It's
that we can start Frankensteining them together and using money in new ways that were
not possible previously because of the centralized control of a lot of intermediaries. And so
what I am fundamentally saying here is while decentralization may be a bug with regard
to responding to legal norms in like real world assets

and that is the heart of my critique of the current structure. I think it
is, as Omid and I have agreed upon elsewhere, a feature in a lot of
other ways. And I actually think one of the most important like features of blockchains
existing and why I've gotten so interested in them is breaking down a bunch of
walled gardens and access controls around these things more than sort of backend responsiveness to
judicial orders. the system that you propose has no composability because if I understand correctly
what you're saying is we're going to permission the asset

issuer at the network layer right do I have that right that like in the
chain that you envision the future circles and tethers would have to get permission from
governance to end to issue an asset but then anybody can hold their token do
I understand that correctly correctly correctly >> I think essentially if you want RWA to
work properly Yes. And the question becomes, what is that permissioning condition, Don. Because the
good part about a blockchain, like I know you and I agree on this, is
we can kind of set the rules of governance in

advance in a transparent way as opposed to having like four dudes in Jackson Hole
in a private room decide whether Caitlyn gets a master account or not. But how
again like your your in your system the validator set for a blockchain will somehow
publicly somehow publicly somehow publicly >> determine whether circle gets to issue USCC on that
chain or not >> vote >> vote >> vote >> how that's a legal governance
thing. It's not a consensus thing, right. Are they going to have voting. >> I
mean >> who's going to decide. My my answer to

that is ultimately OM this all comes back to social consensus and voting with real
world assets. Like whether we like it or not, that is what the current system
is. Because like again to go back to the root of my critique, if the
ETH validators say a transaction is good in USDC and the US government says it's
not, the US government wins. I mean that's the president's state and my point was
that because the ETH validators are not going to get involved, Circle is less likely
to want to do something which then in the long

run will make the US government less likely to do something. Now you're saying that
no, the US government is always going to want to flex its muscle. >> Yes.
>> And we should design the system to give the US government what it wants.
I say no, we shouldn't. We should design the system for to optimize for mitigating
counterparty risk, giving guaranteed outcomes. Whichever one of us turns out to be right remains
to be seen. But I just want to point out in a system where the
validators get to permission the issuer of an asset, there

is no composability because just as easily as the validators could permission a stable coin
issuer, they can deposition that stable coin issuer. And you would have to be insane
to build a massive a like lending market on a stable coin that the validators
could decide tomorrow is no longer allowed on this chain. The risk is there always
and this is a fundamental problem in DeFi that the circles of the world could
do that too. If if circle wanted to tomorrow they could break all of DeFi.
However, if they did that, it would destroy their business.

Their 30-ish billion dollars in um in in market cap would go to zero. The
personal wealth that the executives have built, particularly recently as the sock went public, would
collapse. So, the way the system is designed today, they have a very strong financial
incentive to leave things be in DeFi, which by the way, they have, right. You
know this better than me that Circle has historically actually been resistant to when governments
come and knock in and say we need you to permission this and decommission that.
But what you want to do is take that risk

which I concede is already a liability for DeFi and integrate it at the consensus
layer which to me means that we've just blown up the whole thing. And if
that's what you want then I would like to introduce you to a New Jersey
based firm named DTCC. They already permission everyone and everything for you. They are quite
good at it. They've been around a long time. Uh never been hacked by North
Korea as far as I know. >> It's hard. It's hard to hack paper share
certificates. certificates. >> Can't be hacked. >> They they have

been de demobilized and dematerialized lately. So actually it's mostly now um just electronic ledger.
But my whole point is like >> it might be that what you and I
disagree on is whether the neutrality of an actual permissionless blockchain is desirable in of
itself self even for non-permissioned assets. I think it very much is, but I think
it's valid. We don't know yet, right. It's still, as you've pointed out on other
podcasts, like the size of crypto is still a rounding error to the size of
Trafi. So we'll see what it is. My point is

if you think that is all the world will tolerate then please for the love
of God use a database. Do not use hash functions that serve absolutely no purpose.
Do not incorporate public key cryptography that serves absolutely no purpose other than to slow
everything down and make it needlessly complicated. And do not use words like composable. composability
composability at the end of the day is only possible if the infrastructure is as
neutral as the laws of physics right and you might turn out to be right
I disagree but you might turn out to be right

that that's not what the world is going to tolerate but if that's the case
then sorry bankless guys the podcast is not pointless blockchains are not useful for anything
other than just like meme coins and niche DJN activity also Austin and I are
going to have to find new topics to teach and become experts in because it
turns out that the actual TAM of public permissionless networks is limited to just what
Bitcoin does. All right. So, I have I have two points on this um where
I think it's a little more nuanced than what you've

said though I appreciate the rhetoric. You're like you're good at what you do. One,
I think some of the argument is actually more about the volatility surface of errors.
I would tell you in the current space the problem that we have with blockchains
is they're incredibly fragileized which is to say when you have a system where circle
is call it incentivized in the current way they are which is to resist as
long as possible the problem is what you have there is your volatility is none
none none none none oops right that is to say

at some point the United States shows up at bony melon and it's like give
us the entire reserve and you're just broken because if they find severe enough issues
they're not going do the thing of like, oh, you know, well, we'll negotiate a
little. It's like, we see like $4 billion in the hands of the Iranians. We're
just freezing everything and we'll sort this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out in bankruptcy. And it does all
go to zero. So, it it goes from fine to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right, is how I
would describe it. I am arguing we might be better

with a system that has medium amounts of volatility at all times because those tend
to evolve towards stronger outcomes. Like, OMD, I think part of our disagreement is I
think we are more likely likely likely to get to a future where we force
governments to chill the hell out about like the extreme degree of control that they
currently want by putting these things right in their face and like revealing to everybody
the consequences of what they're doing. I think the current system is kind of trying
to trade away from it disguises like call it the

malfeasants of that. I think it may be better a little bit like you know
when your dog like pees in the house to bring the dog over to it
be like see what you did >> but you want to put it at the
protocol layer right it already exists at the asset issuer layer circle is already heavily
regulated but you want the blockchain to incorporate >> and again I'm not saying that
the validators need to enforce specific transaction restrictions but they should probably enforce some degree
of redundancy if we want to do it this way

because again like there is a nonzero chance that In 2027, we wake up and
100% of circles assets are freezed and then what happens again. Like in the current
system, you're a very binary like it's great, we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And I'm arguing it would
be better to have moderate levels within there is one part of it. Two, to
get to your other point, I actually do disagree with you on the composability thing
because DTCC is a great example here. There are middle states between a fully decentralized
blockchain where we have tens of thousands to hundreds of

thousands to millions of anonymous public validators and five dudes in a broom closet in
New Jersey, right. Like being the controllers of all of this stuff. I do think
there's a pretty good argument as somebody who spent a lot of time thinking about
financial market structure that something like a blockchain because again none of you trust each
other composed of like call it the 500 largest financial institutions in some jurisdiction or
set of jurisdictions that are willing to cooperate is significantly better than DTCC right because
there the ability for individual entities to exert outsized influence

or compromise the system goes down dramatically. So I think it's less binary than like
you've laid it out. I think again it's like the problem with trady people is
we like binary options like we want a zero or one in a fixed outcome
and this is more of a volatility surface problem but I think blockchains are usable
for significant improvements. I do not think private like unilateral blockchains are though like I
think Omid and I both agree that like private bank chains are absolutely a bridge
to nowhere. Why are you doing this. Please for the

love of God just use a database. pointless call it financial companies in the world
to move all these even if we're only talking about local to America is probably
better than the current system. I love this example because first of all, having both
worked at banks, I like to think about the sausage making of creating such a
chain because every bank of 500 institutions, they're all going to have to have a
bunch of lawyers involved. They're all going to have to have a bunch of risk
people involved, bisdev, reputation, and of course, this is going

to be the global clearing layer for everything. So then management and the board is
going to have to be involved. So now we have like I don't know 2,000
to 10,000 bureaucrats in a room and they have to decide how to design a
consortium. Great. Good luck with that. I think that's literally impossible. But for the sake
of argument, I'm going to say that Austin, you you might be the one person
who can pull it off. You're very connected in that world. You're extremely witty and
charming. So you corral the bankers and they agree on

a consortium that they're going to do this. One of the things I love about
permissionless public permissionless chains is that they provide very simple answers to the most fundamental
questions. Who owns it. Who controls it. Who gets to use it. Who gets the
data. Who profits from it. And if I ask those questions about Ethereum, who owns
it. Nobody. Some very diffuse group of stakers, nodes, token holders. >> I've heard it's
a single podcast. right. That controls that thing that is in fact driving the entire
>> um right and then like who gets to use

it. Everyone. How are fees determined by the market. So forth and so on in
the consortium chain example. You've coraled the bankers. They're all going to agree. So equity
>> one, let me be very clear here. I think if it's just banks, it
fails because you have like a specific stripe of narrow interests, right. You need many
kinds of regulated institutions. regulated institutions. >> Even better, who owns it. >> Hold on,
let me finish. Two, I think the way that you end up getting there, and
this goes back to the ownership question there. I actually

agree with Omid. There's zero chance, like zero. You're going to get bureaucrats in a
room and they're going to decide on this. Like, what was the median time to
launch a new product at city was probably like 2 years. And that's just us
making a decision. decision. >> I was going to say never, but you're being more
generous. >> Totally about two years. as somebody who launched one, it was two years.
Um, so >> fat scale outlier. >> Yeah, it Well, again, as you said, I'm
uniquely qualified here, but like joking aside, I don't think

they're going to be able to do it. This goes back to my point of
when you incorporate these things and start forcing people to look at the consequences of
their action. Do you know what does actually dramatically change things is legislation. I think
you have to hold the feet to the fire of the people. It It's a
little bit like, okay, I'm going to reveal that I'm a like OG internet den,
but I was around for like the creation of the malicious compliance subreddit. And I
would suggest to people that this is like my inner

spirit animal of like, you've got to say to people, hey, if these are the
rules you said, we're actually going to do the thing that you said the rules
do. So, like, look at what's happening, you idiots. I would tell you I think
designing chains to operate in this way will force governments to start having to respond
to oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all of this stuff is broken right like actually we need to
fix it and the answer as to how you get to this sort of state
of the world oid is that people will put pressure

on them to bring the hammer down and I think I have way more faith
about that than many people cuz like I've been personally involved in the United States
and like talking to politicians and lawmakers and legislators and regulators and watching watching the
ball move from like the hysteria of like the anti-crypto Biden admin to like degrees
where they were like trying to ban all public blockchains and like committed perjury in
a court in Utah to try to destroy a product. Debt box versus SEC if
anybody doesn't believe me to the point where we're like

passing legislation on this stuff and grappling with these things. I I maybe have more
faith in the political process forcing people to come to these conclusions. And then you
have much more unification between real world governance and what's happening on a blockchain than
the two of them like in sort of like the Cartman versus Jimmy fight from
South Park to determine like whose ledger wins. >> Once again, you have reinvented Trafi
and even if the government compels it, which by the way, >> all the way
down, >> it's uh maybe for you but not for

me. Uh, I'm here for something fundamentally different. And most people might not know this,
but the core infrastructure of Wall Street and Trafi was created in the exact process
that Austin just spelled out. Whether we're talking about clearance systems, settlement systems, uh, payment
systems, DTCC to the Chicago Mercantil exchange to Visa and Mastercard, they all began as
regulatory blessed consortiums where people in suit said, you know what we need. We need
the responsible executives of large corporations to get together and build some kind of important
infrastructure that they all share. And and by the way,

to be fair at the time, great that they did that. It's very important that
we have the kind of tradition up until this point, right. My argument is that
with crypto, we can now go categorically better. But I'm not arguing that we never
should have done this because the result would have been that we would not have
the great capital markets that we do today. That's one of the things that I
think Austin and I agree on that many other crypto people underrate. We should give
credit where credit is due, but we should also study

the history of the exact consortium model that was just proposed. And what ends up
happening over time is the consortium entity realizes that it's more powerful than any one
of its power of its founding members. And then it systematically begins to screw most
of them. The NASDAQ stands for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System.
It began as infrastructure for members of the NASD to trade with each other over
the counter, right. But now it is a public corporation that is probably more valuable
and far more powerful than almost every single one of

its founding members. There is a lawsuit outstanding against the four traders from the good
old days in Chicago, I believe, of the of the Merc, and they used to
be the owners. Most of the trady infrastructure was mutually owned, aka a consortium, and
they're suing that they're saying when the exchange went electronic, it screwed them over, right.
It started preferencing new kinds of financial entities. And it probably did, right. I don't
know about any of the details of it, but the point is, and it's the
same with like Visa and Mastercard. Visa's market cap and

Mastercard's market cap is larger than I would guess 98% of the companies that initially
founded them and they're clearly far far more powerful right they're more powerful than some
regional bank that issues cards on their network so what I'm saying is that while
today if we think about what Austin is proposing it would solve a lot of
problems today it would probably get like more no coiner executive cutives to join it
and issue assets on it. Jaime Diamond, I'm sure, would be all over it because
JP Morgan is already one of the largest owners and

participants of the Trafa infrastructure. So, give him fake crypto infrastructure to control and own
too and he's going to be all over it. But I don't think we're achieving
anything. So, the question then is if we do things my way, is it going
to work or not. And Austin made a great point about reveal preferences that I
think is actually there is more data there than than we know because when I
first started talking about Bitcoin in 2013, the most common response I got particularly from
people who worked in finance was the government will never

allow it. A non-svereign decentralized money or store of value, whatever you want to call
it, that they don't control. Governments the world over will ban it. And here we
are today, the president of the United States is the biggest Bitcoin bowl and we're
debating about whether we should have a strategic reserve or not. So the reveal preference
there was that the decentralization became something that even governments gravitated gravitated towards possibly because
as we experienced during the Biden administration when you try to kill it you only
harm your own people, right. And then with stable coins,

I think I wrote my first blog post arguing something like stable coins are going
to be a killer app in 2018, right. And again there too specifically people like
at City Bank who Austin and I both work with said the government will never
allowed a nonkyced permissionless dollar to exist. They said I don't care about your freeze
and seize capabilities. I don't care about your arguments that more money laundering happens through
Trafi. I don't care about how good chain analysis data is to try to like
catch the bad guys. The government will never allow this

to happen. And here we are in the aftermath of the Genius Act where the
government has actually enshrined the fact that you are allowed to own a let's call
it semi-permissionless dollar because there is the freezes and seize capability which by the way
all the bankers out there if you're not freaking about what this means for you
you should be because this is going to be a huge problem and that's another
thing Austin and I agree on. So I actually think the revealed preference on the
neutrality and decentralization has been that eventually people come around

to it. A lot of things have to get tried in the meantime. A lot
of experiments have to fail in the meantime. I think the fact that many many
many consortium chains have been attempted and like hundreds of millions of dollars spent and
years later they have nothing to speak of has led us to the world where
more and more people are sort of being like begrudgingly dragged to my point of
view including governments. So, one, Omid, I just think you've made a great argument for
my incremental change idea of like, hey, if we put

this in the government's face, eventually they have to start doing things about it. But
two, and this is an important point that I think there's an area of a
lot of agreement on. The reality is we will always be building these castles and
then the next generation of Omides and Austin's and Ryans will have to lay siege
to the castle that we built. They'll build one and then the next generation is
laying siege to that. like there will always be this process of building things and
then they get corrupted and you have to destroy it.

You have to build the next thing. That is the nature of reality. I think
what is important and why I'm less concerned about the permissionlessness of real world assets
is having something like Bitcoin or ETH existing now acts as a check on the
behavior of those things in a way that did not previously exist because you have
an alternative, right. Like I don't think you have to fully co-opt the castle so
long as people have the option to leave the castle and use something else. Like
it mass adoption of permissionless systems is not required. The

existence of permissionless systems that people could mass adopt if the current system is profoundly
corrupt is all that is required to keep them behaving much better. Now, as we
move to uh closing arguments here, you one reflection I have in in listening to
uh both of you and it would fantastic debate. We appreciate you coming on is
that it seems to be the case that we are already we're in the process
of letting all of the exper these experiments play out and we're letting the revealed
preference of the market sort of decide. It seems to

me with crypto there's like kind of three things going on. There's tradi over here,
but there's three things going on in crypto. One of course is the store of
value type of case. Another is DeFi, decentralized finance. And the third might be more
what you were talking about Austin which is open finance. We see all of these
experiments at play. We see the store of value case uh with Bitcoin and Ether.
We see the DeFi case with something like Ethereum, some other ecosystems as well. We
also see the open finance case. You know, Stripe, they

didn't decide to deploy a layer 2. They didn't go on Ethereum. It's a it's
a stripe layer one. This seems to be sort of the open finance maybe that
you're advocating though we haven't seen the details. So as we close out I mean
I think for the listener we're letting all of these experiments play out right and
um who wins the debate or it's a combination of of winners will probably play
out over the next 5 to 10 years because it's all happening right in front
of us uh right now. And I want to throw

this to to Omid for your closing arguments. So I think we started the question
of why does decentralization matter. The two of you both agree that it does matter
very much for store of value for this open finance use case and real world
assets. Omid you're still of the opinion that it greatly matters for that whereas Austin
differs with you on that make your closing arguments for you know uh this debate.
I wrote this blog post not that long ago that vectors of centralization for any
onchain solution are like the exhaust ports of the Death

Star. Eventually, the rebels will find them, not because they're easy to find, but because
the incentive to find them is so high. And if Austin's version of a semi-permissioned
future or consortium future becomes true, it'll blow itself up. So to me at the
end of the day the people, the users, the assets, the companies who issue those
assets and the governments who regulate those companies will find themselves on a decentralized network
because I'm going to garble this, but it's like the quote that uh Churchill said
about America or democracy or something. It's the worst option

except for every other one. Austin, >> I'm going to go back to sort of
the beginning of this, which is I don't think we could ever get away from
the real world or the constraints of the real world and humans are going to
human. So the way I would think about it is this way. Bitcoin is now
your floor. your floor. You have to do better than Bitcoin in order to be
more valuable than people just owning Bitcoin. If ETH works the same way, ETH is
now your floor. You have to do better than ETH

to actually create significant value above that. And where I think I differ with OM
is I don't think transaction preferences are monolithic. There are some areas where like speed
and controls and error reversal are significantly more valuable than others. I care less about
mistakes if I'm buying a $5 sandwich than I do if I'm clearing like $5
trillion of overnight reverse repo. >> For sure. And so I don't think this is
a monolithic system. And I think the real legacy of blockchains is going to be
doing two things at once. And they don't need to

be done in the exact same way at the exact same time, which is one
raising the floor on global conduct in financial markets, which I am just going to
strictly say is a massive, massive improvement in human rights on average over time. And
I think what's happening here is incredibly important. But that number two, it will lead
people to have to cooperate in different ways because now there is a credible alternative
and sort of raise the standard even above that in many things that may themselves
be more centralized over time. So I think what we're

really looking at here is a governance revolution where again I've said I think the
value of decentralization at large is overvalued, but that's just because it will force better
behavior elsewhere. >> Very good. We'll end it there. Of course, bankless listeners, none of
this has been financial advice. As you know, crypto is risky. You could lose what
you put in, but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for
everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot. [Music]
